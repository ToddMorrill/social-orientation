Where was he born, where did he live and what country is the legal succesor to this territory?'''\nMozart was born in Salzburg and predominatly lived in Vienna. Salzburg seized to exist as an independent nation at the beginning of the 19th century, its direct legal successor was Austria and not Germany. As of now Salzburg is not part of Germany but Austria.\n'''2. Does the fact that a country was member of the Holy Roman Empire make all its citizens Germans?'''\nThis is the ultimate question, isn't it? And the answer is clearly no. There is a big number of examples, just two additional ones to those I gave before: Wilhelm Tell (regardless of him being just a legend or a real person),  Metternich (born 1773) listet as an Austrian statesman and politician in every encyclopedia. The wiki-article on the Holy Roman Empire states ''It was never a nation state. Despite the German ethnicity of most of its rulers and subjects, from the very beginning many ethnicities constituted the Holy Roman Empire'' - and that is right, the Holy Roman Empire WAS NEVER a nation state and it has NO successor. Thus Germany cannot claim any person to be a German that has not a specific relationship to it (lived predominantly within the borders of 1871-Germany or was born within these borders).\nAnother thing: you always are saying it is \"historically correct\" to speak of Mozart as a German. In fact you are entirely wrong here - the only historically correct thing to call Mozart would be a citizen of Salzburg and a citizen of the Holy Roman Empire, so therefore neither an Austrian nor a German. However nations today (and this article is about the Germany THAT EXISTS TODAY) are proud of people that are associated with their country and therefore want to call them Austrians, Germans, British etc. And with this regard Mozart can only be considered Austrian.\nUntil you come up with some serious authority (the German wikipedia is not a reliable source and it is nowhere stated there that Mozart was German, nor is it stated that he was Austrian-German) I will keep on deleting Mozart from the article here. |\n| 2 | Themanwithoutapast | and another thing, I don't like this sentence either: ''Many historical figures, though not citizens of Germany in the modern sense, were nevertheless seen as \"Germans\" in the sense that they were immersed in the German culture, for example Franz Kafka and Stefan Zweig.'' This implies that there is no such thing as an Austrian culture or that Austrian culture is some kind of a subordinate thing and German culture should be the umbrella term - I seriously doubt that. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KA4Gmjh4d2Y75GmbSWSfpPY7mNn", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518160, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Themanwithoutapast | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Themanwithoutapast | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3360, "completion_tokens": 50, "total_tokens": 3410}}}

Many find that the official story has inconsistencies and inaccuracies which they would like investigated.\nBelief is not proof. In fact, belief by a large majority of people in something which they have no direct knowledge, is a very poor indicator that their belief is based in fact.\nThe percentage of people believing any particular chain of events involved is thus irrelevant. The numbers quoted (without reference) are, unless whole manufactured, the result of polls conducted using questions and selection methods unknown to us, and thus are immediately suspect.\nAny fool can quote numbersand usually does.\nThe last numbers I saw indicated that only about 40% of US citizens believed the official story. But 5%, 40%, or 95%, the fact that there remain questions in a great many people's minds is indicative that there is perhaps more to the story than the official word states.\nThere are, basically, two major conspiracy theories involved in this series of events:\n1) (The official version,) states that the attacks are the result of the planning and actions taken by an Arab terrorist group.\n2) States that there are a large number of events which cannot be explained by this theory, but can be explained by postulating a group of |\n| 2 | TheAverageAmerican | When I first heard these alternative theories, I was too shocked and frightened to even contemplate their full scope.  But the more research I do, the more it looks like we were lied to.  At the very least, the commission report was rushed, is inaccurate, and was doctored.  Even the 911 hero, William Rodriguez, who personally saved 15 people and went back into the buildings 3 more times and was then trapped the wreckage had his testimony regarding \"hearing explosions before the collapse\" stricken from the commission report.  He now is personally advocating the reopening of the investigation.  Now that more and more people question the events of that terrible day, the real question is now among us:  \"What do we do now?\"  The answer is to speak your mind, and not be afraid to make your voice heard.  When discussing this topic, remain polite, as we are all Americans after the same goal.  Answers.  This is a core belief issue, and many people simply refuse to even contemplate it.  If you are one of those people, ask yourself why you feel that way?  The other things you can do are to do your own research.  Find out how you can get involved in pursuing the answers.  We don't know what the level of corruption was, but there was definitely a great deal of it going on.  If the worst of these possibilities is true: The highest of our government planned/enabled the attacks for political/financial reasons, then we as responsible Americans MUST NOT turn the other cheek.  We MUST hold them accountable, even if it means America goes down in the history books as having one of the most corrupt governments in modern times.  But the fact that the people questioned it, and were able to make change, and bring the corrupt group to justice will show we are a strong country and a patriotic people, who also care for the world, not just ourselves.  We are a government of, by, and for the people, not the other way around.  Do not fear this issue, but rather question it.  Just like our troops have a duty to protect our country, so do we as a people, have a duty to protect our troops, and our way of life.  To learn more, visit any number of sites on the subject, and decide for yourself.  But while you are deciding, keep an open mind.  Keep in mind, that the Government issues sound bites for the average American to repeat in their basic attempt to justify their viewpoint.  And they do not want you to do any of your own investigation.  They know that many Americans are busy with their lives, and frankly, many are lazy in keeping up with current affairs.  They count on it, in fact.  If you watch a state of the union speech...  you can see just how many times a specific phrase is worked in, because they know the average citizen will be looking for guidance and someone to make up their mind.  It was the first speech after 911 when Bush linked terror to bin laden to Iraq to Saddam Hussein.  This was no coincidence.  Free you minds people, and take responsibility for your citizenship.  Be a proud American... remember, our country is based on the ideas of freedom of thought and speech.  They would have you believe otherwise, by trying to make us feel \"unpatriotic\" by questioning our government.  In fact, telling us we are \"unpatriotic\" is actually unpatriotic. \nYour post sounds dangerously close to soapboxing.  Can you please summarize how your post above is aimed at improving the subject article? \nPost not meant as SoapBoxing.  It is further support for the growing percentage of Americans questioning what we were told.  Especially since that is a primary issue with the Sept 11th Attacks page as well as the discussion page herein.  Many places throughout the articles here, numbers of polls are referred to as fact and they are inaccurate and misleading.  By suggesting people to do their own research and make up their own minds, that is in no way soapboxing.     This improves the subject by adding credibility towards the possibility of alternate theories and directly ties into the subject of \"beliefs or facts?\" |\n| 3 | TheAverageAmerican |  |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KA5LByqlz3tjKICRRbufJ5dQ05U", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518161, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| 1 | Wizodd | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 2 | TheAverageAmerican | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | TheAverageAmerican | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3798, "completion_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 3840}}}

Anyhow whatever we say \"philosophy is...\" will turn out to be some description or definition since it appears straight away in the intro.\nThe points I raised above 1-4 do not appear to be as clearly made as I thought.\n(1) still stands, it is too Cartesian and narrowed to a science as \"problem-solving\".\n(2) As to sources, yes I know most of the section is sourced (perhaps why it reads so snakeadly).  The sources are not recommended by wiki policy since they are tertiary ones.\nThis 2nd definition/description of philosophy as an exam of an exam, is an Analytic one.  It neglects Continental and Eastern ways.\n(3)rd description, I was not referring to Biology but to other \"intellectual fields\" (by the way I think the reader might at this stage have realizes Philosophy has something to do with intellect)  It is continuous with the intellect, this, like exam of an exam, is just circuitous.\n(4) So according to you the previous definition/description 1-3 just talks of Western philosophy, not philosophy.  Or else those parts of Eastern philosophy that do not match 1-3 are considered by the article as non-philosophy.  Let me quote the whole sentence here:\nAlthough the word \"philosophy\" originates in the Western tradition, iconic figures in the history of the East have addressed similar topics in similar ways.\nThis says the word originates in the West, now is this meant to be funny, or does it suggest that for other words we use pictograms?  Ergo, what it implies is not the word but philsophy itself is Western, or at lesat the one here described in the intro.  And that a few, only a few, iconic Eastern people happened to do philsophy as intellectual analysis and enquiry, solving and examining exams of problems (by the way, name one problem that has been solved in philosophy?).\nIn general I don't like the way it is aimed at a 12 year old (as a previous editor suggested was our goal), wikiJunior is the place for that kind of hand holding.\nI think the only good thing in the intro is the first part that says as little as possible and the last part that gives some direction to relatively current or live issues in philosophy. (ie, the bit about Analytic/Continental). |\n| 6 | Lucidish | To (1) I have added \"fundamental\". Of course, this increases the Cartesian feeling. But that is not an argument against its inclusion:\n For, yes, I have just lately removed all overt references to \"definitions\" of philosophy. Please join me in being wary of the conflation between definitions with descriptions. It makes all the difference to what we're talking about. If somebody ''describes'' something in one way, then another person may describe it in another; and that's felicitous. By contrast, when someone provides a ''definition'', they stipulate the terms under which we are to exhaust the minimum of some subject at hand. Descriptions are fungible, definitions are (ostensibly) not  at least for any given speaker. Hence, with (2b), we have the supposedly analytic treatment (in terms of higher-order analysis), which is entirely plausible and well-received in the literature  not just analytic literature, but the literature as a whole. But that does not exhaust the subject. So we can, and have, described it in other terms, too.\n If you accept that philosophy is hard to talk about, and you accept that we should be modest in our ambitions  that is, deal in terms of descriptions, and not focus on definitions  then you'll accept that no single description will be satisfying for anyone who is out to get a feeling for the whole field. If you think there are Continental-style descriptions that are being neglected, that they are totally untreated by the current material, and that they really and truly are examinations of what philosophy is (and are not merely expressions of individual philosophical content), then find a source and include them.\n Higher-order examination is '''''NOT''''' \"circuitous\" any more than talking about speech is identical to use of it. It is, perhaps, tedious, or spirallic. Not circular. (I hope I have not misread your use of \"circuitous\", here.)\n Both myself and many others cannot agree to your stance against tertiary sources.\n I can't make any sense of your \"Western\" critique. Give the sentence another read. Nothing like what you suggest is implied.\n Tons of problems in philosophy has been solved if you ask any philosopher who is even mildly interesting.\n Intros are meant to be informative, esp. in giving a picture of the article to come. If you think the prose is Scooby Doo, then add as many polysyllabic words as are needed. I won't, because I find that strategic obfuscation is a thing worthy of contempt.

Lucidish |\n| 7 | Lucaas | 1.  On the issue of it being too Cartesian (with words such Analysis, enquiry, critical, reason, intellect) , you have made worse with \"fundamental\", is this not a mistake?  Also the issue of describing it primarily as \"problem solving\", this you also agree with?  Solving again refers to analysing.\n2b. An \"exam of an exam\", I'm sure is logically ok as you say, but this quite like saying analysis of analysis.  So again it is too analytic a description.  Of course I accept we should be modest in our description but don't pretend that by being modest you get any better a description, as I mentioned before the neat one is my preferred version. It is circuitous in its grammar.  You might be refering here to epistemology, the meaning of knowledge.\nBeing informative in an intro is an aim, but it is exactly not being achieved if you give a pet definition, this is misleading.\nAs to tertiary sources such as encylopedias and dictionaries, it is not only me who is against them, the wiki OR policy strongly prefers secondary or primary sources.\nThe reading as Western is obvious and I have read it again:\nAlthough the word \"philosophy\" originates in the Western tradition, iconic figures in the history of the East have addressed similar topics in similar ways.\nI repeat is this a joke?  The word originates in the West? I suppose unlike all the other words on the page which came from outer-space.  Only \"iconic\" ones in the East addressed similar topics in similar way, no, they have no lesser stars over there.  Since we've given 6 ways and 6 topics all centred around an Analytic and Cartesian, topic and method, just which icon were you thinking of?  If the description is good enough you should not need to add \"eh but Eastern philosophy has icons and and they thought similarly to Descartes and Russell.\"\nOn problems that have been \"solved\" by philosophers I was not asking for a promise of tons, I simply asked you for one.  It is clear you know of none since you could not even give me one.\nAs to other definitions, Eastern, Continental, many were listed earliar on this page, to give one example, Hegel, who says it is \"the expression of an era in thought\".  So, in a way, since your definition is Analytic, and we have agressive Anglophone geopolitics, it happens to fit the bill; but without being consious of it, it remains ideology. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KA41MylKqlE5LPJnGqXgSD9EfBi", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518160, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | Lucidish | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 7 | Lucaas | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3681, "completion_tokens": 45, "total_tokens": 3726}}}

I certainly am not a regular violator of this Wiki policy, or any other I am aware of.\nMost recently (May 13, 2007) I made three reverts during a 24 hour period. But no more than this.\nEarlier there were editing changes to this document, but these were not reverts; they were edits discussed by participants on this talk page, and my editing was an attempt to follow the discussion. On this talk page in the section \u201cLead paragraph\u201d is the transcript of editors working through my editing. A main point of contention was over presentation form. I had introduced quoted material from primary and secondary sources in an attempt to let Jehovah\u2019s Witness representatives speak for themselves. I did this because rival editors preferred to let Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses represent themselves as they prefer whereas other editors desired to take more of an anti approach. This was an attempt to alleviate bickering, and to verify the presentation. But my use of quoted material was objected to, so I removed the quotation marks and left the thorough references as I continued working with editorial views. The discussion then proceeded to how much paraphrase was needed in the absence of quotation marks. Unfortunately accusations of plagiarism were leveled, and addressed. This discussion too is documented in the same section (Lead paragraph). The end of this bit of editing (not reverting) was when rival editor (in the academic sense) Dtbrown replied, \u201cThank you for removing the plagiarism.\u201d\nThe 3 reverts I performed were done after this discussion was over, and not before. However, I do not think even these reverts should accumulate under Wiki policy because Wiki guidelines expressly states that any editor is permitted to remove any language that is not verified in the article. '''The only thing my reverts did was remove unverified declarations''', and nothing more. Hence my impression is these reverts were done entirely within Wiki policy. Nevertheless, I was careful to avoid even a semblance of violating Wiki policy by resisting any urge to delete the same unverified information when it was again reverted back to, by the same editor. Only today has this vying editor finally installed a reference for the offending language (academic sense). And, at this point it remains debatable whether this reference represents a consensus of knowledge on the subject it addresses.\nIn defense of my participation here, even a cursory review of my comments demonstrates a desire to talk about editing prior to making changes. I doubt any editor here will deny the thoroughness I have applied to this discussion, whether they agree with my conclusions or not. I have offered proposals, responded to proposals, offered references pro and con for the subject of dispute. I have even done research at the request of '''and for''' rival editors. Hence it leaves me confused and amazed that any editor would allege what they have of me. |\n| 2 | Anachronist | Don't get bent out of shape. As far as I can tell, you weren't accused of violating 3RR, you were ''warned'' that you were on the verge of doing so. The 3RR violation report page always has erroneous reports where people think that reverting 3 times constitutes a violation.  It doesn't.  The administrators know this, so don't worry about it.\nI suggest you refactor (i.e. delete) this section from this talk page, as it has little to do with improving the article.

I'm not going to make any further edits, as the poor article as suffered enough already.\n1. Metaphysics is about \"what can be said to exist\"?   False, without further qualification.  Usually said to be about what 'ultimately' or 'really' exists, or something similar.\n2.  \"Defining philosophy is controversial in part because it is also its own subject\" is clumsy \u2013 what does it mean?   If it means that the subject of philosophy is philosophy, then as KD pointed out, the subject of literature is literature.\n3.  The claim that there are 'diverse definitions of philosophy' is not true.  Definition of philosophy shows that there is remarkable agreement ''among philosophers'' about what philosophy is.  Or rather, as Quinton says, there are interesting definitions, which do tend to be controversial, and there are dull ones, which are not so.  As KD says, look on the prospectus of any reputable university, and see how it describes itself to prospective students.  There you see remarkable agreement.\n4.  But the most misleading bit is the whole thread of 'some .. others \u2026 still others'.  This, coupled with the earlier insistence on the diversity and disagreement between definitions, suggests quite inaccurately that these 3 groups disagree with each other.  Not at all.  Nearly all philosophers would say that philosophy uses critical analysis and reasoning.  \"It is by its methods rather than its subject matter that philosophy is to be distinguished from other arts or sciences\".   Thus the first group (the 'some') are in fact the majority of philosophers.  The second group are the ones who 'claim that philosophy examines the process of examination itself', i.e. think of philosophy as somehow second-order.  This forms a sub-group of the first.  The third group think that 'philosophy is continuous with the best practices in every intellectual field' \u2013 still not sure what this means (and it will certainly be unintelligible to the average reader of the article), but I know from Ben it was intended to be a group that disagreed with the assessment of philosophy as second-order.\n5.  I don\u2019t like 'seminal figures in the history of the East', but that's a point of style.  Seminal figures of what?  Why 'seminal'.\n6.  Don't like 'Contemporary Western philosophy is divided into continental and analytic traditions'  because it introduces an idea without definition and explanation.  If I know no mathematics, and I am reading an article to understand it, it does not help in the slightest to know that it is divided into pure and applied mathematics.  Whats that? |\n| 2 | Lucidish | Some of these judgments are a bit harsh, I think; perhaps I think that because I wrote the Snake (albeit hastily). Alas.\n It is one thing to say that (1) is misleading or partial, and quite another to say it is false. I take it that what metaphysicians do in the style of Wittgenstein-I is to discuss what can be discussed sensibly. Perhaps this is misleading, but it isn't false, since there is no universal quantifier in the original statement (though perhaps one is implicit).\n (2) is well-received but not on point: the allegation in the content is that in philosophy both its use (i.e., particular philosophies) and mention (i.e., philosophy itself, the word \"philosophy\") are disputed, more or less as is being proposed in item (3). Perhaps this is unclear when we take one sentence alone, but in context the point ought to shine.\n I would prefer that the item in (3) read \"there are diverse ''descriptions'' of philosophy\", since \"definition\" is bound to be controversial. I'm not sure I like (3) either, but it's a compromise in the face of epistemic relativists.\n Item (4) is not supposed to suggest an antagonism between the views, which is something I thought I had fixed from an earlier version; evidently not successful.\n No doubt (5) and (6) are easily fixed.  Lucidish |\n| 3 | Lucaas | Avoiding discussion of the snake version until now, I wanted the neat one. Anyhow the definitions in the snake are given in this order\n1. Analysis, enquiry, critical, reason etc....(nice Cartesian-mind adjectives) deployed in order to '''to solve seemingly intractable problems'''\nThis effectively gives \"problem solving\" as the definition.  It is one I do not agree with since, it is not primarily an attempt to progress forward past problems, or deflate them.  This problem-solving idea is more like science or psycho analysis.  Though I know this idea was prevalent in Analytic philosophy.\n2. '''Examines the process of examination'''\nWell I know there are examinations at University, and doctors examine bodies. Examine again is too analytic.\n3. '''Best practices in every intellectual field'''\nThis is a strange way to define it, I suppose all the other \"fields\" say the same thing, So this is just an attempt to pass off the issue.\n4. Eastern philosophy is defined as a mirror of Western (\"similar topics in similar ways\")\nThis is an agressive use of Western philosophy as, presumably defined in 1-3, to pretend Eastern does the same thing.  Especially when 1-3 are given, as I suggested, in mainly Analytic terms.  So you copy what happens with Anglophone agression in geo- politics to philosophy, and philosophy becomes froth.\nWhy also is the snake duplicated beneath a banner? |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KA4z9eqze3IrsqZKtb1gBI7SmLf", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518160, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Peter Damian (original account) | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 2 | Lucidish | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Lucaas | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3797, "completion_tokens": 63, "total_tokens": 3860}}}

Anyhow the definitions in the snake are given in this order\n1. Analysis, enquiry, critical, reason etc....(nice Cartesian-mind adjectives) deployed in order to '''to solve seemingly intractable problems'''\nThis effectively gives \"problem solving\" as the definition.  It is one I do not agree with since, it is not primarily an attempt to progress forward past problems, or deflate them.  This problem-solving idea is more like science or psycho analysis.  Though I know this idea was prevalent in Analytic philosophy.\n2. '''Examines the process of examination'''\nWell I know there are examinations at University, and doctors examine bodies. Examine again is too analytic.\n3. '''Best practices in every intellectual field'''\nThis is a strange way to define it, I suppose all the other \"fields\" say the same thing, So this is just an attempt to pass off the issue.\n4. Eastern philosophy is defined as a mirror of Western (\"similar topics in similar ways\")\nThis is an agressive use of Western philosophy as, presumably defined in 1-3, to pretend Eastern does the same thing.  Especially when 1-3 are given, as I suggested, in mainly Analytic terms.  So you copy what happens with Anglophone agression in geo- politics to philosophy, and philosophy becomes froth.\nWhy also is the snake duplicated beneath a banner? |\n| 4 | Lucidish | (1) The problem here is not with the sentence, but with the term \"definition\". 'Definition' should be removed or at least clarified. (2) \"Examination\", I believe, was what the indicated source said. If not, then \"enquiry\" or whatever can replace it. Whatever you think isn't \"too analytic\"  whatever that means when we're speaking in such general terms. (3) That's not true at all; i.e., biology doesn't study literature at a higher-order level. (4) Eastern philosophy is not mentioned as such (implying a homogeneous tradition); rather, what is written is that some thinkers from the East have addressed similar topics in similar ways. I've replicated the relevant passage from Cua on this talk page before, it shouldn't be hard to track down and compare if you are doubtful, think it is a lot of Western projection, etc.\n As for the replication: who knows? It's not appropriate anyway, since the remarks are sourced.  Lucidish |\n| 5 | Lucaas | It says \"describes as\" not definition.  Anyhow whatever we say \"philosophy is...\" will turn out to be some description or definition since it appears straight away in the intro.\nThe points I raised above 1-4 do not appear to be as clearly made as I thought.\n(1) still stands, it is too Cartesian and narrowed to a science as \"problem-solving\".\n(2) As to sources, yes I know most of the section is sourced (perhaps why it reads so snakeadly).  The sources are not recommended by wiki policy since they are tertiary ones.\nThis 2nd definition/description of philosophy as an exam of an exam, is an Analytic one.  It neglects Continental and Eastern ways.\n(3)rd description, I was not referring to Biology but to other \"intellectual fields\" (by the way I think the reader might at this stage have realizes Philosophy has something to do with intellect)  It is continuous with the intellect, this, like exam of an exam, is just circuitous.\n(4) So according to you the previous definition/description 1-3 just talks of Western philosophy, not philosophy.  Or else those parts of Eastern philosophy that do not match 1-3 are considered by the article as non-philosophy.  Let me quote the whole sentence here:\nAlthough the word \"philosophy\" originates in the Western tradition, iconic figures in the history of the East have addressed similar topics in similar ways.\nThis says the word originates in the West, now is this meant to be funny, or does it suggest that for other words we use pictograms?  Ergo, what it implies is not the word but philsophy itself is Western, or at lesat the one here described in the intro.  And that a few, only a few, iconic Eastern people happened to do philsophy as intellectual analysis and enquiry, solving and examining exams of problems (by the way, name one problem that has been solved in philosophy?).\nIn general I don't like the way it is aimed at a 12 year old (as a previous editor suggested was our goal), wikiJunior is the place for that kind of hand holding.\nI think the only good thing in the intro is the first part that says as little as possible and the last part that gives some direction to relatively current or live issues in philosophy.

As far as I can tell, you weren't accused of violating 3RR, you were ''warned'' that you were on the verge of doing so. The 3RR violation report page always has erroneous reports where people think that reverting 3 times constitutes a violation.  It doesn't.  The administrators know this, so don't worry about it.\nI suggest you refactor (i.e. delete) this section from this talk page, as it has little to do with improving the article. These comments really belong on your talk page. - |\n| 3 | Pseudo-Richard | I have become the object of a complaint alleging me as a regular violator of Wiki\u2019s 3 revert rule.(''Wiki policy prohibits use of my name in the complaint, but there is no doubt I am the subject, and the complaint was made according to Wiki policy and every editor has this prerogative'') This talk page is pointed to for administrative review of this allegation; hence I address it here for whomever.\nI categorically deny having violated Wiki\u2019s 3RR. I certainly am not a regular violator of this Wiki policy, or any other I am aware of.\nMost recently (May 13, 2007) I made three reverts during a 24 hour period. But no more than this.\nEarlier there were editing changes to this document, but these were not reverts; they were edits discussed by participants on this talk page, and my editing was an attempt to follow the discussion. On this talk page in the section \u201cLead paragraph\u201d is the transcript of editors working through my editing. A main point of contention was over presentation form. I had introduced quoted material from primary and secondary sources in an attempt to let Jehovah\u2019s Witness representatives speak for themselves. I did this because rival editors preferred to let Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses represent themselves as they prefer whereas other editors desired to take more of an anti approach. This was an attempt to alleviate bickering, and to verify the presentation. But my use of quoted material was objected to, so I removed the quotation marks and left the thorough references as I continued working with editorial views. The discussion then proceeded to how much paraphrase was needed in the absence of quotation marks. Unfortunately accusations of plagiarism were leveled, and addressed. This discussion too is documented in the same section (Lead paragraph). The end of this bit of editing (not reverting) was when rival editor (in the academic sense) Dtbrown replied, \u201cThank you for removing the plagiarism.\u201d\nThe 3 reverts I performed were done after this discussion was over, and not before. However, I do not think even these reverts should accumulate under Wiki policy because Wiki guidelines expressly states that any editor is permitted to remove any language that is not verified in the article. '''The only thing my reverts did was remove unverified declarations''', and nothing more. Hence my impression is these reverts were done entirely within Wiki policy. Nevertheless, I was careful to avoid even a semblance of violating Wiki policy by resisting any urge to delete the same unverified information when it was again reverted back to, by the same editor. Only today has this vying editor finally installed a reference for the offending language (academic sense). And, at this point it remains debatable whether this reference represents a consensus of knowledge on the subject it addresses.\nIn defense of my participation here, even a cursory review of my comments demonstrates a desire to talk about editing prior to making changes. I doubt any editor here will deny the thoroughness I have applied to this discussion, whether they agree with my conclusions or not. I have offered proposals, responded to proposals, offered references pro and con for the subject of dispute. I have even done research at the request of '''and for''' rival editors. Hence it leaves me confused and amazed that any editor would allege what they have of me. |\n| 4 | Pseudo-Richard | '''Amatulic:''' I do not appreciate having my section from the Jehovah\u2019s Witness talk page move here. Wiki stipulates that \u201cUnresolved disputes between editors, whether based upon behavior, editorial approach or validity of content, can be addressed through the talk page of an article.\u201d Since my behavior is in dispute then I opt to address on the talk page where the alleged misconduct occurred. This is according to Wiki policy.\nAnd, you are dead wrong about the allegation. George M has accused that I am a regular violator of the 3RR. You can find it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Religion_and_philosophy. You can verify this is his accusation based on his contribution log here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/George_m.\nNow I respectfully request you return this material from whence it came.

In the tape, bin Laden admits foreknowledge of the attacks.[77]\n....\nThat is a blatant falsehood.  First of all, Osama bin Laden does not appear in this video tape.  The imposter on the tape is wearing the same\nkind of hat Osama wears in other videos. However, Osama has a convex\n\"semitic\" nose, whereas the imposter has a turned-up nose.  The hair color at the top of the beard, under the lower lip, is a different color\nfrom Osama's.  Osama's beard hair is relatively straight. The imposter's\nis kinky.  Osama has a pattern of baldness around the corners of his mouth, but the imposter's beard goes straight across.  Osama has an irregular patch of gray/white hair in the center of the beard, just above the chin.  The imposter's beard - and this is most telling  has obviously been bleached in a thorough, symmetrical manner in this same area in a deliberate attempt to make this actor resemble Osama from a distance.  NOT ONLY THAT, but various experts have attacked the audio content of the tape.  According to someone who had translated authentic Osama tapes, the voice on the tape is not Osama's,  the objections Osama raises concerning American actions in the middle East are missing and the rhetoric the speaker uses is completely dissimilar to Osama's. Additionally, according to various experts, the official U.S. government translation of the tape takes unacceptable liberties.  A word is added to one sentence to suggest foreknowledge of the attacks, and an entire sentence is also added.  Although the text was obviously written by American agents, they did such a sloppy job of it that it doesn't even CONTAIN a confession.  It was obviously not FOUND in Afghanistan by Americans, but PLANTED there.  \u2014The preceding unsigned comment was added by   \u2022 . |\n| 9 | WLRoss | The lead is made up of beliefs rather than facts, not a good way to write an encyclopaedic article.The reason bin Laden has not been indicted is, according to the FBI themselves, because there is no evidence linking him to 9/11.

This implies that there is no such thing as an Austrian culture or that Austrian culture is some kind of a subordinate thing and German culture should be the umbrella term - I seriously doubt that. |\n| 3 | John K | To view \"Austrian\" as somehow distinct and mutually exclusive from \"German\" before 1866 is simply wrong - up until that point every German-speaking Austrian can ''most certainly'' be described as a German, just as much as any Bavarian or any W\u00fcrttemberger or any Hessian, and more so than German-speaking inhabitants of East Prussia, which was never part of the Germanic Confederation or the Holy Roman Empire.  As to other points - yes, Alsatians before 1648 would be (and generally are) considered to be Germans.  So are Swiss Germans before the 14th century or so, and so forth.  The Czechs are obviously a special case, because not only were they not German-speaking, but the Kingdom of Bohemia was in some sense a specifically Czech political unit within a larger German political unit.  So things get complicated there.  A place like the Duchy of Lorraine would also be complicated.  It is not complicated at all for Italian lands in the Holy Roman Empire, or the Kingdom of Arles, because these areas were never considered part of Germany.  The Holy Roman Empire had three parts - the Kingdom of Germany, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Kingdom of Arles/Burgundy.  The latter two would never have been considered German.  At any rate, of course Mozart was German, although he was Austrian too (although I, too, would hesitate to call him Austrian based on his birth in Salzburg, not then a Habsburg possession).  Let me add that many figures originally from areas not in modern Austria made their lives in Vienna prior to 1866.  Among others, Metternich was a Rhineland prince.  Beethoven was from Bonn.  The Habsburgs themselves came originally from Switzerland.  But, so, yes, anyone from the modern country of Austria (except the Burgenland, which was part of Hungary) who lived before 1866 can most definitely be called a German, and in many contexts probably should.  To act as though \"Austria\" was a distinct nation before 1866, or that the boundaries of the modern Republic of Austria mean anything before 1918, is a complete anachronism. |\n| 4 | John K | Let us also remember that as late as 1848 the Frankfurt Parliament, considered to be the beginning of German democracy, included representatives from those parts of Austria which were in the German Confederation, and that it elected as Vicar of the new German Reich Archduke John of Austria, the Emperor's uncle.  (Later, of course, it took a Kleindeutsch position, but, again, we cannot simply assume the Kleindeutsch position as inevitable).  Mozart was certainly German, and Metternich was even more German. The Habsburgs were not only German, they were the ''monarchs of Germany'' until 1806.  Again, Czechs are a special case, and groups like Lorrainers and Sorbs and Belgians are somewhat special cases, but German-speakers living within the Holy Roman Empire simply ''have'' to be considered as Germans. |\n| 5 | Andries | May be I am mistaken but I learnt at school that Kafka could be considered German. |\n| 6 | Heimdal | I think we can do without the Austrians and the Swiss here. Anyway it wasn't me who added Mozart. Germany has produced its own great composers, such as Bach and Beethoven. - |\n| 7 | 83.109.160.91 | Austrian is a subset of German. Prior to 1871 \"German\" is only an umbrella term covering the entire German Nation, which includes Austrians, Prussians, Bavarians etc. There was no \"Austrian culture\" which was different from \"German\". The Austrian culture may have been different from, say, East Prussian or Schleswigian, but they were all equally German. There were much greater differences between Bavarian culture and Prussian culture, than  it was  between Bavarian and Austrian culture (which was and is pretty much the same). 83\nAlso note that many parts of the modern state of Germany have been for periods part of the Austrian state. |\n| 8 | Heimdal | 83.109.xxx.xx writes above: \"Austrian is a subset of German.\" Perhaps. But this article is about Germany, and I think we can do without the subsets.\nBTW, 83.109.xxx.xx. - I think you should log in if you want to continue editing this page. Creating an account doesn't cost you a cent. Should you refuse to log in, I for my part intend to remove your edits without further notice. I hope you understand. - |\n| 9 | Stephan Schulz | No, actually we cannot do ''without the subsets''. Every element of a set is part of some subsets... With regard to the concrete case, Mozart is very much part of the German culture. One of his major accomplishments is writing Italian-style operas to German language librettos.

He initially ignored it, and then when I brought it up again a week later, he said it was \"ancient\" (even though it had just been started two weeks earlier).  See Talk:Franco-Mongol alliance#Request for comment. He also tried creating a POV fork on a related issue, and the community was pretty much unanimous against that too.  See Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mongol conquests and Jerusalem. His response to that was \"no big deal.\" He was initially totally resistant to mediation, but after a couple ANI threads, he's at least giving it a try, but so far we haven't had any luck finding a compromise on anything. See Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Franco-Mongol alliance.  If we don't start making progress, it'll probably have to go to ArbCom, but I haven't given up complete hope of mediation yet.  You may also wish to check out the FA review on another of his articles:  Wikipedia:Featured article review/Indo-Greek Kingdom where we're seeing some of the same complaints from other editors:  Ownership, reverting other editors, incivility (calling other editors vandals), over-use of primary sources, misinterpretation of secondary sources, cherry-picking words to promote a biased POV, etc.  It's a shame that this may have to go further up the chain via Dispute Resolution, as PHG has done a lot of good stuff on Wikipedia (he's a genius when it comes to locating images).

The issue is that there is a POV dispute there, about such issues as whether or not the Mongols were in Jerusalem in 1300, and whether or not Hetoum was in Jerusalem in 1300.  There is a medieval source which says he was, but most modern sources say that the medieval source was unreliable.  While we're sorting this out, unless there's someone who's extremely knowledgeable on the subject and would like to help out, it's probably best to just leave the \"disputed\" tag on the article. |\n| 2 | Eupator | Isn't the tag way too strong, not to mention unnecessary? Your objection is regarding the attack on Jerusalem right? Nowherere is that mentioned as 100% solid fact. The statement is attributed to its source. Why not simply follow up with a line saying historian X believes that was just Christian propaganda of the time? '''  ''' |\n| 3 | Elonka | Well, you're right, I could have just removed or edited the material, but the problem is, that every other article that I've tried this, PHG just reverts me, and to be honest, I'm getting tired of the edit-warring, so I'm fine on just tagging things as disputed and moving on. If you'll check Talk:Franco-Mongol alliance, you can see that we've had lengthy discussions on this, and despite clear consensus from other editors, PHG just ignores everyone and goes on and does what he wants, while at the same time throwing back all kinds of counter-accusations to confuse matters.  As regards the quote about Hethoum that was added here, we've had multiple confirmations that the information is unreliable. We've also had multiple editors criticize PHG's practice of trying to promote a POV by including selective quotes from primary sources. PHG knows this, and yet he chose to add the information to this article anyway, without any kind of a qualifier.  He has been doing this at other articles too (like we were just edit-warring at Jacques de Molay yesterday).  Rather than get into a detailed discussion at each and every article, to maintain my sanity, I've decided to just tag things as disputed, and try to direct centralized discussion back to the mediation page where it belongs. |\n| 4 | Per Honor et Gloria | Hi Elonka. Please feel free to do as suggested by Eupator: simply follow up with a line saying historian X believes that was just Christian propaganda of the time. I don't think I have very often deleted such additions to Franco-Mongol alliance (on the contrary, I am all in favour of balancing arguments, with proper references. I have rather been reinstating referenced material you had deleted). Regards |\n| 5 | Elonka | In my opinion the quote should not be listed at all.  It's from an unreliable source, is not corroborated by ''any'' other of the medieval historians, and has been repeatedly criticized by modern historians.  Angus Donal Stewart was very clear that the claim was \"absurd.\"  Reuven Amitai pointed out that it was clearly Armenian propaganda of the time.  It shouldn't be included in an article about Armenian history, because it's just going to cause confusion, especially the way that it's being set off as some sort of an important quote. |\n| 6 | Eupator | Isn't that in itself interesting and notable? Wikipedia:Reliable sources doesn't apply to medieval primary sources. No policy is violated. It's subjective isn't it?  Again, why not just modify that paragraph placing it in a broader context with third party modern sources. Just because the claim isn't true doesn't mean it should be suppressed. We just need additonal information from modern scholars. Angus Donal Stewart is a perfect source imo for this task.

I visited the link to Adult Web Movie Database (awmdb.com) from Teagan's article, and after inspecting it, realized that the page was a bunch of spam links.  None of those links on her \"webography\" actually feature her.  The page doesn't have any real information or pictures of Teagan outside of a 61 x 78 pixel thumbnail.  Why is this site allowed to have external links on a lot of adult performer pages?  It adds no new content and appears to be breaking the external link policy.  \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by |\n| 2 | BladedSquirrel | As far as I'm aware it lists websites that she appears on. The links are similar to the links IAFD has for her (for which she is currently linked). If you click on her link for IAFD and then gallery page you will see 'spam' links to pornstar.com (goes to http://galleries.blingbucks.com/movie/10/teaganpresley/?a=12627 - notice the a= is the affiliate number). Click on any of the DVD names she's been in and you get 'spam' links to over half dozen DVD/VOD sites which when clicked through show an affiliate id that earns them money.\nYou can't have been too thorough with your attempt to see if it provided genuine information as it's not too difficult to find said information.\nIf I click on her Adult Web Movie Database external link and I see a bunch of website names - like IAFD all affiliated up, no different. Click for instance the whorgies link and you see Teagan on the third page of that site, click on the 'details' link on the Adult Web Movie Database website in her profile and I see that the scene contains details of the stars in the scene ( Teagan Presley, Melissa Lauren, Tyla Wynn, Katja Kassin, Lucy Thai, Ariana Jollee) and also what the scene contains (orgy, movies and pictures).\nThe information is the website credits - exactly like IAFD's is the DVD credits. It has about as many spam links as IAFD. In fact IAFD has more due to the amount of DVD shop links for each DVD and the gallery link. There was a discussion in another talk page and the conclusion was to add links in the external links area of the Wikipedia Pages. |\n| 3 | BladedSquirrel | Also looking at your contribution history you make a lot of effort to add links to the Adult Film Database profiles of pornstars, so what is your stance on the fact that Teagan's profile on AFDB contains 28 affiliate 'spam' links to galleries that earn them money and each DVD listed in her profile has 4-6 links to DVD and VOD sites. You seem to have no issue with the fact the Adult Film Database does exactly the same!? In fact you actively modify stars profiles to link to AFDB despite the fact AFDB contains approximately 330 spam/affiliate links with Teagan's profile alone (on the basis each DVD in her profile on the site contains an average of 4 links per DVD page). Are you keen to remove all links to AFDB as well? |\n| 4 | 67.184.76.20 | ~~\nNone of the links on the Adultwebmoviedatabase.com web page for Teagan Presley have anything to do with Teagan Presley.  The fact of the matter is if you go to Adultfilmdatabase.com and you click on a Teagan link it actually is her movie, her scene, her picture, etc.  IAFD.com is an awesome informational site that provides scene breakdowns and the galleries on their site also go to the said performer.  Adultwebmoviedatabase.com provides nothing but links to galleries that don't even have Teagan Presley in them... As far as anyone is concerned, the page has nothing to do with Teagan Presley.  \u2014Preceding unsigned comment added by |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KASrEojS68zA9yv6dZoDRcIIiUn", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518184, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 67.184.76.20 | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 2 | BladedSquirrel | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | BladedSquirrel | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 4 | 67.184.76.20 | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3478, "completion_tokens": 88, "total_tokens": 3566}}}

During the time of her care, more than nine physicians are known to have examined her, including eight neurologists. All of the neurologists save one concurred in a diagnosis of PVS and six of them so testified in court\u2014the one dissenting diagnosed a minimally conscious state. Ultimately, a Florida circuit court, presided over by Judge George W. Greer, held an evidentiary hearing, at which he heard testimony from five of the neurologists, as well as other evidence, upon which he ruled that Schiavo was in a PVS. This finding was upheld on every appeal, both in state courts and in federal courts.''\n  1 July 2005 21:13 (UTC) |\n| 2 | Duckecho | Note to NS: I meant to confess this before\u2014I intentionally used ''procedures'' (as in life prolonging) instead of ''interventions'' for the reason I discussed earlier. I did, however, leave hidden notes regarding the efficacy for each depending on the context of the argument. Given that any dispute over the phrase will more likely be from a legal standpoint, I hope you'll agree that my choice is arguably better if not medically precise. It might be worth noting both words and their application in the indepth part of the article. Thanks for your input. I didn't want you to think I had ignored you.   1 July 2005 21:47 (UTC) |\n| 3 | GordonWatts | The way it's worded is POV by omission bias: I'm glad that the factual accuracy is being revisited, and I'm not saying that I think this is inaccurate (not sure here), but when loads of doctors have weighed in, and the only one mentioned are primarily FOR the \"PVS\" diagnosis, then this is POV. I realize that many doctors didn't personally visit her, but the fact that the courts only let the \"Pro-PVS\" neurologists visit her (with one apparent exception above), and then we punish the article by excluding mention of the others in this section here is basically not unlike when a bully pushes a person down, and then complains when the person yells. In this analogy, I assert that Greer \"pushed\" the process down on the ground, by excluding many doctors who could have given input, and then when editors are criticized for trying to mention these other doctors, we must respond that it is not our fault, but the court's fault. We are doing the best with the hand dealt us. Therefore, if you include a lot of ProPVS doctors in the intro, you must include a similar (even if not equal) number of AntiPVS doctors. If you have a problem with this, then I give my \"blessings\" for you to include mention of which ones actually visited personally with Terri, so this is not leading the witness, or comparing \"apples with oranges,\" ok? '''''(PS: If you include this intro you propose, Duck, you are sure to \"make the natives restless,\" if you know what I mean.)''''' |\n| 4 | A ghost | Gordon, this is an excellent example of the two different standards of fact being discussed in Mediation.  In fact, I'll point Ed to it.  Now, your logic implys that the neurologists were hand-picked by the court (Greer), and that they went to examine Terri with prejudice.  This is deeply disturbing, because it implys that these doctors are unfit to practice medicine.  Further, this seems to be directly contradicted by Duck's timeline.  His paragraph implys that the neurologists were not picked by the courts, and that we can assume that they examined Terri without any previous assumption of PVS.  Please briefly explain to us which of these is true.\nYour other assertion is that the opinions of other doctors that didn't directly observe Terri should be valued.  I think Sen.

Frist's ''mea culpa'' is sufficient to explain why they should not. 2 July 2005 06:02 (UTC) |\n| 5 | GordonWatts | '''\"Now, your logic implys that the neurologists were hand-picked by the court (Greer), and that they went to examine Terri with prejudice.\"''' Now, I certainly do not say that the court picked all of the neurologists; I wasn't speaking on that subject, but if I were, I would have said that the court did not let very many doctors examine Terri because had they done so, there would have been a different outcome: Terri would probably have NOT been declared PVS by a majority, so they had to limit access to Terri to a \"select few chosen\" doctors. My original point was this in my post above: I was trying to say that including a whole bunch of ProPVS doctors in the intro section of the Schiavo article, and only 1 or 2 AntiPVS doctors was POV. The fact that loads of doctors who are trained professionals were so certain of their diagnosis that they gave the Terri's parents affidavits is not only worth mentioning, it is worth mentioning in the same intro section along with the few \"special\" doctors who were permitted in. '''\"This is deeply disturbing, because it implys [sic; implies] that these doctors are unfit to practice medicine.  Further, this seems to be directly contradicted by Duck's timeline.\"''' I don't know how the timeline is relevant, unless you want to say that some doctors saw Terri first, before others submitted affidavits, and somehow use this as reason to exclude some doctors from being mentioned in the intro section. However, you seem to think I implied that some doctors are unfit to practice. Well, I won't go that far, but I think some doctors are quacks -or at least unqualified. If that is not so, then how come the 5-doctor-panel mandated by the court all disagreed with one another? Do you think it is merely coincidence that the family's doctors said Terri was NonPVS and that Mike Schiavo's doctors said that Terri WAS PVS? No way! That was not coincidence. The doctors all had biases. Why not include a load of other doctors' analyses and diagnoses, doctors who were not subject to such bias as being paid by one siad or the other to be a \"hired gun?\" Besides those solicited by Terri's parents (they probably didn't get paid like the first 5), and others who have opined in the news media? I'm sure we could find 20 or 30 doctors who have opined on either side, but I have heard (and I don't know if it is true or not) that MOST doctors who had knowledge of Terri said she was NOT PVS; if they are trained medical professionals, I'm sure they know when they don't have enough information, yet roughly 2-thirds of the doctors who opined one way or another said Terri WASN'T pvs, according to my meager memory.

''\"yet roughly 2-thirds of the doctors who opined one way or another said Terri WASN'T pvs\"'' lemme see, you wouldn't happen to be including the 3 dozen or so doctors who saw the 4.5 minutes of video from the Schindlers and signed affidavits, would it? See, most of those doctors don't actually say \"Terri is not PVS\". What they actually say is \"Terri ''appears'' to be ''responding'' and more tests should be done.\" that isn't the same as saying \"Terri is not PVS\". Greer also mentions that some of the affidavits suggest that various specific tests ought to be tried, but those tests ''had'' already been tried, therefore revealing that the doctors who signed some of those affidavits didn't even know Terri's medical history. A bunch of doctors suggested the fMRI, but they also said that fMRI is an experimental procedure that ought to be conducted in a ''university'' setting as part of their research, not as part of a medical diagnosis. So, while I'm sure you would eagerly include every single doctor that the Schindlers managed to con with their 4.5 minutes of CGI video, the affidavits actually reflect how little the doctors actually knew of Terri's history.  3 July 2005 01:53 (UTC) |\n| 7 | FuelWagon | Oh, I tweaked the intro to read: \"More than eight doctors examined Schiavo neurologically.\" the \"more than\" will allow us to insert the other two doctors when they become public record. and the \"neurologically\" allows for many other doctors who worked on Terri for other reasons.  3 July 2005 01:59 (UTC) |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KAqjCiIvbVX9bB23n2iNltFUDIB", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518208, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | GordonWatts | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | FuelWagon | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 7 | FuelWagon | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3713, "completion_tokens": 60, "total_tokens": 3773}}}

In her last years, Schiavo was examined by at least 8 neurologists, all but one of whom concluded that she was in a PVS. An evidentiary hearing held by a Florida court to determine the most credible assessment of her state of consciousness found that the \"evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that Terry Schiavo [was] in a persistent vegetative state.\" This finding was subsequently upheld on every appeal, both in state and federal courts.''\nThis is about 30 words shorter, and I think it avoids confusion by leaving out the \"doctor mathematics,\" which can be detailed in the relevant section of the body of the article.

I believe this is error is a result of Affirming_the_consequent.\n logic: therefore, an image decompressed at 1000:1 was not neccessarily compressed at 1000:1 - this logic is valid.\n premise 2: if a fif compresses an 1x resolution image at 50:1 and then is decompressed at 1000:1, the resulting image quality ''or better'' can be achieved if a 20x resolution image is compressed at 1000:1 and subsequently decompressed at 1000:1. - asserted by me (Kevin Baas), Editor5435, and the guy who wrote the FAQ.\n logic: it follows from premise 2 that opinion 1 is true - this logic is valid, thus the conclusion follows if premise 2 is true. |\n| 2 | Spot | \"The guy who wrote the FAQ\" is John Kominek and he said \"My opinion is this. Kevin Baas begins with a correct characterization (first quote) but draws the wrong conclusion (second quote). Erik Reckase and Spot are raising important relevant facts, and demonstrate proper understanding.\" Quoting Wohlberg: While \u201cresolution independence\u201d has been cited in the popular technical press as one of the main advantages of fractal compression [117], there is little evidence for the efficacy of this technique. Subsampling an image to a reduced size, fractal encoding it, and decoding at a larger size has been reported to produce results comparable to fractal coding of the original image [21], although there is no indication that replacing the fractal interpolation stage by another form of interpolation would not produce comparable results. Comparisons with classical interpolation techniques indicate that, while fractal techniques result in more visually acceptable straight edges than linear interpolators, they are inferior in terms of the MSE measure [118]. An alternative study [119] found slightly better results for the fractal technique in isolated cases, but a general superiority for the classical techniques. |\n| 3 | Editor5435 | Once again the concept we are discussing escapes your comprehension. Will you ever understand? \"comparable to fractal coding of the original image\".  NO, we are comparing the quality of upscaled fractal images to 1000:1 wavelet compression of the original.\n\"although there is no indication that replacing the fractal interpolation stage by another form of interpolation would not produce comparable results.\" I don't think so, fractal scaling by its very nature is superior to various forms of interpolation.  There has already been plenty of discussion about this.  You continue to twist this discussion to meet your own agenda which is why your contributions to the article have little value. |\n| 4 | Kevin Baas | If you look at his response to the second quote, and my response to that, you'll see that what he was refering to was me taking \"fractal zooming\" out of the context of fractal compression, and that I was responded \"I know.\"  My guess from you misunderstanding is that you did not read it.  (In the future please get your self up to speed on the discussion before adding to it.)  I imagine then that you also missed \"9) If one is careful, it is possible to speak of very high compression ratios and resolution enhancement in the same breath...\"  which is the part that I was refering to when I said he asserted premise 2.\nRegarding inferiority in terms of RMSE, I'd like to see his examples to show this.  I've already provided links to papers which show a comparision of fractal compression/decompression against the best noise filter, which is closely related to interpolation.  And genuine fractals 5.0 happens to be the industry standard in interpolation, so essentially the best graphic designers in the world disagree with that guy. Now you seem to be arguing against having a fractal interpolation section in the article, when before you were all for it.\nAnyways, what does this have to do with what I wrote?  Are you disputing that the opinions are properly attributed, that the premises are?  Or are you disputing my analysis of the logic? |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KB2lG21hMOFCyHyuWm6lb90xDLe", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518220, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Kevin Baas | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Spot | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 3 | Editor5435 | Cold |\n| 4 | Kevin Baas | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3699, "completion_tokens": 67, "total_tokens": 3766}}}

(In the future please get your self up to speed on the discussion before adding to it.)  I imagine then that you also missed \"9) If one is careful, it is possible to speak of very high compression ratios and resolution enhancement in the same breath...\"  which is the part that I was refering to when I said he asserted premise 2.\nRegarding inferiority in terms of RMSE, I'd like to see his examples to show this.  I've already provided links to papers which show a comparision of fractal compression/decompression against the best noise filter, which is closely related to interpolation.  And genuine fractals 5.0 happens to be the industry standard in interpolation, so essentially the best graphic designers in the world disagree with that guy. Now you seem to be arguing against having a fractal interpolation section in the article, when before you were all for it.\nAnyways, what does this have to do with what I wrote?  Are you disputing that the opinions are properly attributed, that the premises are?  Or are you disputing my analysis of the logic? |\n| 5 | Spot | and , you are in continued and repeated violation of WP:NPA.  Please desist.  \n\"Genuine fractals 5.0 happens to be the industry standard in interpolation\" this statement is from the company that sells GF5, so it violates WP:RS.  In my opinion, whatever Photoshop does by default is the industry standard.  And regardless of how good or popular GF5 is, the question is really \"can fractal interpolation substitute for compression\", and the answer is \"no\".  Wohlberg is copiously referenced; his examples are in the 100+ papers in the bibliography, and the many graphs and tables in the paper.  This kind of independent literature review is a perfect source for this article.  So no, I am not arguing against a section on fractal interpolation (see my draft above for my proposed text).  I am arguing that this section should agree with Wohlberg.  I may well paraphrase some of it into the draft. |\n| 6 | Kevin Baas | WTF are you talking about?!?!

Your objection seems to be against the list in general, that can't be helped, since its the facts on this particular metric. You can propose a merge though - check WP:MERGE. It would make some sense to have the 3 tables side by side (ie. one big table with Emissions, Emissions/capita, Emissions/gdp). |\n| 8 | Xiaoyanggu | I wasn't objected to the factualness of China as being top emitter throughout and actually it is my word (edited while I was out of town), since earlier, China was named as \"chief\" emitter, which is misleading at least. I am not against the list. However, I do think combining the lists is a more faithful way of telling the facts. I do object to the way China was singled out. I  do think if China is singled out, the statement about the per capita data should be included. I am against singling out China. If the list itself is sufficient, then why would it be necessary to separately write about China being the top. I am ok with editing the list with new data and removing the comments above the list altogether. If we can reach a reasonable consensus on letting the list tell the story, I or whoever is willing, can remove the comments above the list altogether. Personally, I do think carbon emission is a issue and am very concerned about its impact. I am not saying China is doing a good job on this. But making China look bad is not going to help. Letting the most developed industrialized countries like US hiding behind China on this issue has the potential of making it worse, especially considering the fact that the per person impact on this is much worse in the US and countries with similar economic power (per person) plus the fact that a lot of China's emission is caused by consumption in these countries. I do think China should be criticized over the issue of energy efficiency and since it has a high population, improving efficiency is a place where most improvement can be made. Singling out China as top emitter without saying the relatively lower per capita emission is only going to give a fake image that the US and similar countries are now not the worst. I can only understand that as using wikipedia to attack China instead of stating fact in good faith. If it takes 5 lines to make the situation clear, I wouldn't have insisted on that. But it only takes half a sentence.    Kim, Thank you for suggesting the merge link.

Ratel, we don't take disputes to ArbComm just like that. There is a whole process, and ArbComm is the last stop on the line. (Well, there is another stop, called StartYourOwnDamnWiki. But hardly anyone goes there. Andyvphil is irritating, but, yes, a short comment period doesn't necessarily establish consensus, but it can certainly show lack of it. There is no consensus at this point for the insertion of *some* of the material proposed, and there is indeed, as Osbojos points out, an increased level of verifiability necessary for controversial claims with the biographies of living persons. But we can't say what tomorrow's consensus will be, no door is closed. \"Edit warring\" to remove controversial material from a BLP, as long as it is at all reasonable, and definitely Ratel's position is within that territory, isn't likely to result in block unless it is clearly contrary to consensus. Edit warring in the other direction is much more likely to be blocked. So, given this, I'd suggest everyone relax. If someone wants to continue to rant and rave and foam at the mouth, well, eventually the dog-catcher will arrive and take him away. Whatever side he's on. The article protection can be extended if needed, and it does not prevent improvement of the article. What we can agree on here can rather easily be incorporated. What is over is the possibility that simply by reverting enough times, one can control the text, at least for part of a day. To Andyvphil, if you want to improve the text from your point of view, there is a clear path: first of all, be civil and polite. I like Bill Moyers, but not enough to support concealing anything verifiable  and balanced  about him. Insulting other editors is not a great idea if you are trying to find consensus with them. Seek consensus, with civility, and you might be able to accomplish something more than just getting yourself blocked. |\n| 2 | Ratel | Right, since Abd feels all editors must agree to obtain consensus (which is clearly not going to happen here), I'll succinctly put my objections to the main remaining issues: 1) the inclusion of the condemnatory words by the Church Committee (CC) and 2) the Deke DeLoach (DD) seating affair.\nThe CC's words related to the actions of ''many'' people over ''many'' years. As far as I know, none of the WP pages relating to these people carry the CC judgements, so why should the Moyers page, unless a POV is getting pushed?\nThe DD affair about convention seating amounts to a relatively ''unknown'' incident that DD ''claims'' happened. Now immediately that raises red flags: we are not supposed to be reporting little known facts on BLP pages, especially so if the fact is derogatory. If you don't know that, you ought to read the rules more carefully. And quite apart from that, the page on Regnery Publishing shows that it is simply a right wing front organisation e.g., the same people who published the Swift Boat smear. Read the Regnery Publishing talk page. Everyone knows that Regnery is one of the major purveyors of books by right-wing attack dogs like Anne Coulter and G. Gordon Liddy. What they choose to publish about one of their greatest enemies, Moyers, is not for inclusion here, when it comes only from one man, Deke Deloach, who only became deputy director of the FBI in 1965 (so he was not \"#3 at the time\"), and who, according to Ronald Kessler in ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', once attempted to blackmail Senator Carl T. Hayden. This is not a reliable source. And even if by some miracle this incident actually did happen, it is simply not notable ''prima facie'', because Moyers was merely a conduit for LBJ's orders, and because the order was not enacted. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KBPjv7V0FIQVcshQfyeXNsTmoBv", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518243, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Abd | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Ratel | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3451, "completion_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 3494}}}

This article is justing listing countries by carbon dioxide emissions, there is no place to placing kind of justification for these numbers (because it is possible to \"justify\" all 207 figures. So i am deleting that statement, until consensus about adding it is made. |\n| 3 | Xiaoyanggu | Well, I disagree and hold my earlier position. The western countries have been attacking China by presenting data in misleading ways. The cost for making the issue clearer is tiny, while the impact of it can be and is large. I think, in order to keep wikipedia politically unbiased. It is necessary to present both honest content and in a way that reduces the possibility that it can be misread. Especially, when the cost for clarity is small.\nOtherwise, I can agree on completely removing the paragraph that contains the part that singles out China, since it is a list after all. Can let the reader read the list and draw their own summaries. And as for the up-to-date-ness of the data, you can update the entire list using latest data that reflect China's new status.  By singling China out, wikipedia is taking on a position. |\n| 4 | KimDabelsteinPetersen | xiaoyanggu, sorry but there may be people who want to single China out - but the reality is that the US was singled out in ''exactly'' the same way before this information became available, so the \"singling out\" is rather evenhanded. I btw. agree that other measures than country specific emissions are more important (taking demographic, economic and/or size into account). But this article is about country emissions, there are others about per capita and per gdp. |\n| 5 | KimDabelsteinPetersen | Nb. as far as i know there is no up-to-date data yet. Which is why its presented with the caveat of preliminary estimations. |\n| 6 | Xiaoyanggu | Thank you, Kim. Yes, US was probably singled out for the same reason. If it is necessary to single out China on this issue in wikipedia, the right way to do it is NOT saying it is top emitter without saying the per capita emission is 1/4 of that of US, which, as we all know, is misleading. China does lag on energy efficiency. And if any people objected what I edited in this page, I don't mind them singling out China for emissions per GDP. Also, there has been no contest for including a small diagram about the per capita data in the page for quite a while. I cannot agree with Jklamo about removing, for the reason of irrelevance, the statement about comparison about China and US's per capita data. I personally feel that per capita and per GDP measures about emissions should all be merged into this article to give accurate and complete picture and the issues. Especially, merging the 3 articles mostly will lead to a table with a few more columns that will not become messy to fit in one page. I can see only positive effect by merging them.(well, in terms of truth and complete truth, not in terms of views of people with certain political biases and/or intention) |\n| 7 | KimDabelsteinPetersen | Xiaoyanggu, but they are the top emitter as a country (or with reasonable probability) will be. Your objection seems to be against the list in general, that can't be helped, since its the facts on this particular metric. You can propose a merge though - check WP:MERGE. It would make some sense to have the 3 tables side by side (ie. one big table with Emissions, Emissions/capita, Emissions/gdp). |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KBEqge04zLrIUCJZmQwDSv4p0e6", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518232, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Xiaoyanggu | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Jklamo | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 3 | Xiaoyanggu | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 4 | KimDabelsteinPetersen | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | KimDabelsteinPetersen | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 6 | Xiaoyanggu | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 7 | KimDabelsteinPetersen | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3538, "completion_tokens": 126, "total_tokens": 3664}}}

As far as I know, none of the WP pages relating to these people carry the CC judgements, so why should the Moyers page, unless a POV is getting pushed?\nThe DD affair about convention seating amounts to a relatively ''unknown'' incident that DD ''claims'' happened. Now immediately that raises red flags: we are not supposed to be reporting little known facts on BLP pages, especially so if the fact is derogatory. If you don't know that, you ought to read the rules more carefully. And quite apart from that, the page on Regnery Publishing shows that it is simply a right wing front organisation e.g., the same people who published the Swift Boat smear. Read the Regnery Publishing talk page. Everyone knows that Regnery is one of the major purveyors of books by right-wing attack dogs like Anne Coulter and G. Gordon Liddy. What they choose to publish about one of their greatest enemies, Moyers, is not for inclusion here, when it comes only from one man, Deke Deloach, who only became deputy director of the FBI in 1965 (so he was not \"#3 at the time\"), and who, according to Ronald Kessler in ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', once attempted to blackmail Senator Carl T. Hayden. This is not a reliable source. And even if by some miracle this incident actually did happen, it is simply not notable ''prima facie'', because Moyers was merely a conduit for LBJ's orders, and because the order was not enacted. |\n| 3 | Osbojos | Sorry for the abrupt change of opinion, but now that I've had a little more free time to carefully consider the issues at hand, I realize I was failing to see the forest for the trees. I agree with Ratel that the Church Committee \"improper\" characterization is not referring to Moyers specificallythe language appears in the introduction to a section detailing \"Examples from the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations illustrat{ing} failure to distinguish between political and nonpolitical intelligence.\"\nRegardless, if the \"improper\" reference were referring to anyone, it'd be Lyndon B. Johnson, not Moyers. Not only is this event not mentioned on the LBJ page, but mention of Johnsonlet alone Moyersisn't even made on the Church Committee page. If this finding isn't notable enough to be mentioned in the CC or LBJ pages, it's hard to justify including it on the Moyers page. In fact, the only reason this event would be sufficiently notable to be included on the Moyers page is precisely because his taking part in efforts to ferret out homosexual activity runs so counter to his public persona, and, as far as I can tell, everyone participating in the talk page discussion agrees that the only source for the homosexual activities detail is Silberman (and his accompanying verifiability problems). Unless it can be verified that Moyers asked specifically for evidence of homosexual activity or some other equally uncharacteristic requestas opposed to say, damaging information in generalit's hard to see how the Hoover incident is notable enough to merit inclusion here.\nThe Deloach allegations, in addition to being non-notable, fail for lack of verifiability for much the same reasons the Silberman allegations failed.\nThus I don't believe either proposalAndyvphil's or Ratel's compromisecan justifiably be included in the article. |\n| 4 | Andyvphil | The Church Committee actually named very few as having solicited totally improper acts of the FBI. Here's the list again: p.227 (Roosevelt, Eisenhower(unspecified aide), Robert Kennedy, Johnson) and p.228 (Moyers, Marvin Watson). DeLoach changed titles in this period, but was #3 throughout. See the inside front flap of his book. Your assertion that the actions of subordinates are \"''prima facie'' not notable\" is simply silly, as is your suggestion that info in books published by Regnery can, per policy, be ignored. I'm interested in your assertion thiat this incident is \"unknown\".

I'm interested in your assertion thiat this incident is \"unknown\". What accounts of this period in Moyers' life omit it? |\n| 5 | Abd | Perhaps. However, how much fuss has been made about this incident? I don't know, but it's possible that the ''fuss'' is notable, in a way similar to the Swift Boat Veterans incident is in the Kerry bio. Would this be in the Moyers article? I don't find the answer obvious. In any case, what was in the text, for example, the text claiming or implying that the Church Committee condemned ''Moyers,'' was inappropriate. Suppose the President sent a telegram to the FBI asking for the name check. Would this be a notable incident in the career of someone who delivered the telegram? Probably not. Moyers, it appears, may have regretted being involved in quite a number of different situations with Johnson, but the ethics violation here would be ascribable to Johnson, not to Moyers, at least not based on what I've seen. The President asks his aide to ask the FBI for a name check. Who is in charge? If it was a crime being requested, then Moyers would have had an obligation to refuse. But for the President to ask for a name check, then, wasn't a crime and it probably isn't one now. It was unethical, that can certainly be argued, but it is not unethical for an aide to the President to deliver a request as ordered. I noticed before that the Church Committee document didn't make that unethical charge against Moyers personally, but against the action of querying the FBI, and it was an example of Presidential actions, not of the actions of aides to Presidents. But if there is a major charge levelled at Moyers, notable in itself, I could see that this could be described in the article, but that charge, unless proven by reliable source, can't be stated as fact. The \"fact\" is that the charge is being made. And I'm not at all sufficiently familiar with this to have an opinion yet. |\n| 6 | Andyvphil | Likening Moyers responsibility for his actions as LBJ's chief of staff to that of someone who delivered a telegram seems simply wrong to me, and is in any case not the point of view of the Church Committee, which would not have named Moyers had they agreed with you that he was just an errand boy. Not saying you can't include that POV on the event  as I've noted, I've quoted DeLoach making exactly that defense of Moyers' other request of him  but it's not a reason to exclude the other POV. Btw, Moyers wrote about this event in ''Newsweek'', March 10, 1975, an article called \"LBJ and the FBI\", but I haven't found more than a few scattered quotes yet. |\n| 7 | Andyvphil | For more on DeLoach, see this.\n...This source says DeLoach was 4th highest FBI man as of Aug 1964. \nAnd here is Moyers giving Hoover the ok to spead dirt on Martin Luter King, something RFK had previously prohibited. Make sure you read the footnote. |\n| 8 | Ratel | And that source says: \"Lyndon Johnson, '''''acting through Moyers''''', had now given Hoover a green light to discredit King...\" which is what we've being trying to tell you.

Osbojos admits that if what Moyers did for LBJ was \"counter to his public persona\" it belongs in this article. Oddly, he then goes on to assert that merely doing something the Church committee described as totally improper doesn't rise to that level unless compounded by the specification that Moyer's request for derogatory information specified homosexuality as the deogatory information desired, and never mind that Lasky and Silberman say exactly that and no source says otherwise. It will be interesting to see if he thinks that Moyers telling the FBI that \"it was both '''his''' and the President's opinion\"  ''should'' \"go ahead and disseminate\" its hit piece on MLK (''Judgment Days'', by Nick Kotz, Houghton Mifflin (not Regnery), 2005, footnote, p. 234), something Kotz characterizes a \"authorizing Hoover to spread defamatory information throughout the government\", rises to the level of being \"counter to his public persona\". |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KBgCnfdQVXs1pMp3yzcq5w9RliS", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518260, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 8 | Ratel | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 9 | Andyvphil | Assured-Dominant |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3021, "completion_tokens": 46, "total_tokens": 3067}}}

It must Clearly say what you say is true. You cant say \"well i THINK this means this\" or something like that.\nIf your going for OPINION you must clearly state it. Chances are your going for others opinions like fans. Therfore a official site isnt the way to go for this as a official site cant speak for all fans. You must find a site where the fans themselves leave their opinions. Ex: IliaxLink site. the important thing is that the fans clearly state thats their opinion so it doesnt have to be a fan site as long as some fans say that is their opinion.

It needs to be released from the official source, or covered in a reputable source such as IGN News or the New York Times. This isn't an issue of biased editing - this is simply an issue of one side completely refusing to adhere to the WP:V guidelines which are ''not'' optional on this wiki. |\n| 3 | Thetriforcehero | unencyclopedic content, unacceptable sources. to add \"fans think\", you need to produce professional polling, or else I could add \"fans think Midna is a cockchugger\", and source it to a random blog.  You have a point but its either this or do u wish to continue with the fat MidnaxLink or IliaxLink argument?\nas for your last comment you have a point however notice that it doesnt say all it says many and its true too many fans DO think Midna is a cockhugger and many fans DO think Ilia is a annoyance i dont belive in either one of those but some zelda fans do. This is on both Midna and Ilia pages I find it fair and its really not doing any harm its preventing all these edits. Thats the main reason why i want it to stay.

Tempers are flaring, including mine, over what should be a simple matter, and for my part, I apologize.  I realize I'm not exactly the easiest person to deal with, but let's try to clear the air and resolve this.  And for what it's worth, it's not just us - this entire discussion has already taken place once.  So, why don't we try to lay things out and decide once and for all.\nI think part of the problem is we've lost sight of the underlying issue, namely the importance of easy understanding vs. accuracy.  Nobody here disputes that there are a myriad of terms which can refer to the tuatara: \"reptile\", \"amniote\", \"diapsid\", \"basal diapsid\", \"sphenodont\", \"Sauropsid\", etc.\nI further think that we've resolved the issue of paraphyly being a problem - we're using ITIS classification, and \"reptilia/sauropsida\" is recognized in both ITIS and the scientific literature, regardless of the paraphyletic nature of the clade.\nThis, IMHO, leaves only the issue of communication.  Which term is best for the intro?\nPersonally, I favor reptile for the following reasons:\n1) It's clear and understandable to most readers\n2) Other, potentially less-clear terms, would either confuse the reader or have them click the link, which, while accurate, would disrupt the reading of the introductory sentence.  To me, that seems like a rather serious impediment to readability.\n3) Other terms do not contain any more information.  They are either taxonomically equivalent or nearly so.\n4) Further details on the animal and it's exact phylogeny are laid out in the next section.\nOk, let's try to resolve this thing without killing each other.  What term do you favor, why do you think it's preferable, and what impact will it have on the article regarding clarity, accuracy, and information content, especially considering that this is an introductory sentence. |\n| 2 | Dinoguy2 | Just a comment on this issueEditors on science articles, myself included, often forget how close we are to the material and how much lingo an average person would never understand, take one look at and walk away to find a source they can comprehend. I don't think we should dumb things down but we should lead the reader in gently to a lingo-heavy article. Use broad, general, easy to understand terms in the intro and then delve into specifics in the body. Referring to a tuatara or crocodile or ostrich in the intro as a \"sauropsid\" serves no purpose other than to demonstrate how enlightened the editor is to cutting edge classification schemes, and leaves the average reader completely in the dark. Reptile is fine as an informal term just as fish is. Use that in the intro text, go into detail in the classification section.\nThat said, a lot of the argument also smacks of original research, or preferencing some papers over others. A Google scholar search for \"tuatara reptile\" provides plenty of papers using the term reptile from the past few years, so it clearly has not been completely abandoned in the technical lit, and pretending it has here would be inappropriate. |\n| 3 | Papa Lima Whiskey | I'm sorry Dinoguy, but that is not constructive. I proposed, as a compromise edit, to use the term sauropsid, because it is monophyletic. Monophyly is not negotiable for the lay person, they will get their heads completely twisted if we persist in using paraphyletic taxa, because they do not represent evolutionary relationships. It turns out that God didn't separately create these creatures in the way the scala naturae (which, btw, Mokele is also opposed to - unless speaking with two tongues) suggests: fish then amphibians then reptiles then birds then mammals. Evolution created these things roughly in a tree, and monophyletic taxa represent this accurately. This is absolutely nothing to do with showing off knowledge. '''The only objective is to use monophyletic taxa.''' |\n| 4 | Dinoguy2 | I'm sorry, if contemporary sources are still using \"reptile,\" you are wrong. Not to mention the fact that Reptilia has been defined monophyletically a few times, and every time it has included tuatara. There's a difference between reflecting current science and reflecting only the science you wish were universally accepted. That's the definition of bias.

So you can all stop trying to guess what the average reader would or would not be confused about. I am not confused at all by the term Sauropsid. Rather I find it intriging and useful. I also find the assumptions that anyone without a degree is unable to understand what is going on without using the word \"reptile\" to be insulting. All anyone wil even half a notion about what a reptile is has to do is look at the picture and the answer is clear. During the time this article used the word amniote, there was no giant influx of confused average joes, wandering lost in the forest of articles becouse the term reptile wasn't there. That's proof of the average reader's behaviour. (And contrary to your belief Mokele, there is no requirement on WP that people have degrees in specific subjects to edit them. Nor does having a degree make your opinion count more. So don't even go down that road.)  | |\n| 10 | HCA | Are you *seriously* telling me that if you go up to 20 people in the street and ask them what a sauropsid is, they'll all know?  Shit, I'll bet half my department doesn't know (especially the ecologists), and I'm at an Ivy-league school.\nAnd as for insulting the average reader's intelligence, you're the one who thinks they're too stupid to read more than one sentence of the article - a full explanation of their taxonomy is the FIRST SECTION, complete with a cladogram.\nThe fact that wikipedia did not explode due to the use of amniote is irrelevant - there is little to no feedback unless the user wants to actively edit.  How can you know how many people left to google a description elsewhere or just thought \"what's an amniote? looks like a lizard to me.\" and didn't edit?  You have no actual indication of user satisfaction at any level but the most coarse and uniformative.  \nSo far, all I've heard is an objection to the paraphyletic nature of reptilia (which is irrelevant, since it was long since agreed to use ITIS classification for reptiles, which includes \"reptilia\"), the claim that \"sauropsid\" is widely known (clearly false), and the claim that it can be just clicked on to understand.  This last claim has actual substance, so let's examine it.\nThe wikilinks in an article are one of the great strengths of wikipedia, but over-reliance on them is the biggest weakness of many articles.  If a reader can't make it through a sentence without reading 3 other articles, there's a problem with clarity, doubly so if it's the first sentence.    Wikilinks are not a substitute for readability, and if something can be made readable, it should be.\nSecond, the irony is that clicking on Sauropsid takes you straight to the reptile page, meaning that unless you want to edit the redirect, most people who click on it will simply assume it's a synonym of \"reptile\" and wonder why we didn't just say \"reptile\".  In fact, there is no reference anywhere in wikipedia to sauropsids including bird, just as a synonym of \"reptile\".\nIf we use \"reptile\", some users will just assume it means what they think, and never investigate further.  Others will read further in the article and find the section explaining their phylogeny.  If we use \"sauropsid\", some users will ignore it in favor of the picture (which they will mentally class as a lizard), others will click on it, find that it goes to reptile, wonder why we didn't use that term, and just hit the back button and keep reading the tuatara article, and finally some will read further in the reptile article and learn about their paraphyly, which they could have also learned from the tuatara article.  The only difference I see is that \"reptile\" involves less clicking, less distractions, and superior readability with absolutely no change in information content. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KCNIsOj7ee0DRYE5hDrW4ZmylYb", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518303, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | Pschemp | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 10 | HCA | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3485, "completion_tokens": 45, "total_tokens": 3530}}}

Not to mention the fact that Reptilia has been defined monophyletically a few times, and every time it has included tuatara. There's a difference between reflecting current science and reflecting only the science you wish were universally accepted. That's the definition of bias. As long as the term is still active in published lit, in an encyclopedia, it is extremely disingenuous to ''pretend'' it is not, or to presumptively declare the papers that do use it obsolete by their omission. That's fine for a Knoll, but not for a Wiki. Here, our objective is not monophyly. Our objective is simply to summarize published literature. |\n| 5 | Papa Lima Whiskey | Mokele has persistently tried to inject the rumour that I'm denying the placement of tuatara in Reptilia - nothing could be further from the truth. I will repeat again. '''Monophyly is everything'''. If you want people to understand evolution (and oh, do we have edit wars over creationism) then paraphyly is the intellectual equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot. The importance for taxa to be monophyletic by your very example (creation of Sauropsida, Reptilia being redefined) is well recognised in taxonomy. I believe that general, evolutionary biology trumps specific niches where the message hasn't arrived yet (as Mokele is doing his best to paint herpetology). |\n| 6 | Papa Lima Whiskey | And just to squash that idea completely, you know as well as I that our reptile article is not written in a monophyletic way (\"are air-breathing, ''cold-blooded'' vertebrates that have skin covered in scales ''as opposed to hair or feathers''\"). |\n| 7 | HCA | Why is monopyly everything?  Yes, I know it emphasizes common ancestry, but it also fails to account for extreme divergence of one lineage from the rest of the taxa in the clade.  Consider \"Sauropsid\" vs \"reptile\".  If you tell me that you're studying a desert-dwelling Sauropsid, I'll have no idea what to expect, but if you tell me you're studying a desert-dwelling reptile, and I'll be able to make all sorts of \"first approximations\" about the likely activity, diet, thermal biology, mating system, even size of the organism.  Why?  Because the group \"reptiles\" all share a large number of plesiomorpic traits (such as ectothermy and carnivory) which makes them more similar to each other than they are to birds. You can't just jump on the \"monopyly bandwagon\" and go to town without serious thought about how well it applies to various situations.  By analogy, consider \"species\" - there's technical definition of \"two populations which don't or can't exchange genes\", but in real, actual biology, it's nowhere near that clean cut.  Plenty of species have hybird zones, or intermittently hybridize under certain conditions (shit, I've even seen two separate instances of cross-GENUS hybrids), especially in plants and asexual species.  You can't just take a definition or concept you read in a general-audience book and rigidly apply it without regard to context, diversity, or the current scientific consensus. |\n| 8 | Pschemp | Dinoguy, the claim that ordinary people are too uneducated to understand Sauropsid is both wrong and a disservice to the readers of the encyclopedia. This is exactly what wikilinks are are for, so people can click on terms they want to learn more about. No one is arguing that Tuatara aren't reptiles. The problem is that the definition of reptile is not the most useful term due to its mish mash of inclusions. Sauropsid on the other hand is more specific, and thus more useful. If just the term reptile is used, no casual reader will ever be prompted to dig deep enough to realize that there are serious problems with the old class due to advances in evolutionary biology. It's not like the term Sauropsid was invented yesterday, or even 20 years ago. Its been around for a long time. Wikipedia is here to capture the sum of human knowledge. If class definitions are changing, such as the old Reptilia, our information should reflect that. Ignoring such things is making the assumption that readers are too stupid to understand current issues, and that is quite wrong.  | |\n| 9 | Pschemp | Oh and I am the average reader because I don't have a degree in Biology. So you can all stop trying to guess what the average reader would or would not be confused about. I am not confused at all by the term Sauropsid. Rather I find it intriging and useful. I also find the assumptions that anyone without a degree is unable to understand what is going on without using the word \"reptile\" to be insulting. All anyone wil even half a notion about what a reptile is has to do is look at the picture and the answer is clear. During the time this article used the word amniote, there was no giant influx of confused average joes, wandering lost in the forest of articles becouse the term reptile wasn't there. That's proof of the average reader's behaviour. (And contrary to your belief Mokele, there is no requirement on WP that people have degrees in specific subjects to edit them. Nor does having a degree make your opinion count more. So don't even go down that road.)  | |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KCHDFla9CnDixmttlPwZZfXlBhd", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518297, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Dinoguy2 | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 5 | Papa Lima Whiskey | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | Papa Lima Whiskey | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 7 | HCA | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 8 | Pschemp | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 9 | Pschemp | Gregarious-Extraverted |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3811, "completion_tokens": 109, "total_tokens": 3920}}}

I feel this page should refrain from making any such judgment.  If anyone can present clear factual information on this subject which avoids charges of elitism, boosterism, and POV bias, please add it and cite your sources. |\n| 2 | Fuzheado | I agree we should avoid trying to rank them on this page.  H/Y/P indeed do have good brand recognition, but then you'd be surprised that overseas Columbia often has more brand recognition than Princeton.  It really depends.  So unless you can cite specific studies and poll numbers, it's best left off this article. |\n| 3 | Acornlord | Fuzheado does have a valid point in saying that Columbia sometimes does have better recognition overseas than Princeton. However, I am going to put the comment about prestige back in with one modification: that H-Y-P has more prestige in the United States than all the other Ivies. There are specific statistics available to back this up: (1) The YIELD rates (% accepted students matriculating at that college) for HYP are much higher than Columbia or any other Ivy (>65% at HYP vs. <55% at Columbia, and less at all other Ivies  this claim can be verified simply by accessing Admissions sites at these schools); (2) A quick search on Lexus-Nexus will reveal that prestige is most often associated with HYP (vs. Columbia et al.) For example, take a look at this site: http://www.suntimes.com/output/education/cst-nws-feeder02.html. Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are listed as the top 3 institutions sending undergrads to top graduate programs. There are dozens of articles similarly placing HYP at the top prestige-wise, so it's pretty clear that there is a really big gap between HYP and the rest. (3) It is also worth taking a look at statistics relating to the choice a student will make if he or she is accepted to multiple schools within the Ivy League. It is generally known, for example, that more students choose Harvard over Yale (~3:1 ratio) given the choice to attend either. When it comes down to HYP vs. Dartmouth/Cornell, there's almost no contestalmost all students accepted to both HYP and D/C choose HYP.  Therefore, I am justified in putting my original paragraph back in. This is not a matter of elitism or boosterism; it's about certain truths being made available to the public, which is the purpose of Wikipedia. |\n| 4 | Bcorr | This seems to be a pretty obscure distinction, and as in the article on Dartmouth, I would opine that the material in question is too subjective belong in a relatively short article. The focus should be on describing what the Ivy League is, rather than ranking the schools. The article on Harvard is the place to discuss it's being one of the most prestigious of U.S. universities. |\n| 5 | Acornlord | No, I disagree with the above post. It is of great interest to the public to know which schools are considered better than others. Why do you think U.S. News and World Report is so popular? Also, the material is not subjective either. If you believe it is subjective, you should cite data stating that some people feel Dartmouth is higher in prestige that HYP. I contend that you will not find any such statistics. |\n| 6 | Rbellin | Acornlord, the statistics you cite justify only two conclusions: (1) that H-Y-P are popular choices with their admitted undergraduates and (2) that H-Y-P place well in graduate admissions (though there is a problem of circular reasoning in your claim that \"top schools\" place well into \"top graduate programs\").  \"Prestige\" is too nebulous a claim to be supported by either of these.  Among other things, perceived quality of the institution varies widely from field to field.  For instance, and here I speak from personal experience, certain departments at Princeton are merely good-to-above-average, not \"elite\" or \"prestigious.\"  There are at least a dozen non-Ivy universities whose departments in certain fields are significantly more \"prestigious,\" that is to say esteemed in their field, than any Ivy school's you care to name.  And to take your example, Dartmouth's CS department is at least as \"prestigious\" in this sense as any of HYP's.  General, school-wide prestige of universities is too ill-defined and subjective to be indisputable, factual, or encyclopedic. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KCT8yRnkx4vC3iId2hU0kfvIWss", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518309, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Rbellin | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Fuzheado | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Acornlord | Assured-Dominant |\n| 4 | Bcorr | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 5 | Acornlord | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 6 | Rbellin | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3610, "completion_tokens": 100, "total_tokens": 3710}}}

Among other things, perceived quality of the institution varies widely from field to field.  For instance, and here I speak from personal experience, certain departments at Princeton are merely good-to-above-average, not \"elite\" or \"prestigious.\"  There are at least a dozen non-Ivy universities whose departments in certain fields are significantly more \"prestigious,\" that is to say esteemed in their field, than any Ivy school's you care to name.  And to take your example, Dartmouth's CS department is at least as \"prestigious\" in this sense as any of HYP's.  General, school-wide prestige of universities is too ill-defined and subjective to be indisputable, factual, or encyclopedic. |\n| 7 | 130.132.94.68 | Rbellin, no one is comparing Dartmouth's CS department with HYP's CS departments, nor is anyone saying that Dartmouth's CS is lower than HYP's. That earlier statement I had put in referred to the overall perception of members of the Ivy league universities. In general, HYP is more widely recognized as a whole and within the general population than is Dartmouth or any of the other Ivies. If you think this is somehow \"nebulous\" or \"ill-defined\", then you are mistaken. Grab any college guidebook and you'll find HYP at the top. You also miss the point when you say that \"there are at least a dozen non-Ivy universities who...blahblah\". This article is about Ivy league universities; I had specifically written \"all Ivy league universities are prestigious, but some are more so than others\". No where did I imply that HYP is \"better\" or more \"prestigious\" than non-Ivy leagues schools. Although I conclude that your arguments are invalid, I will let things stand as they are for the sake of preventing further disputes. |\n| 8 | Lowellian | There's a reason the term \"HYP\" exists. Whether Harvard-Yale-Princeton is actually better than the other Ivies may be debatable, but in the ''popular perception'' of people in the United States, those three Ivies tend to stand above the rest, which is why the sentence should be allowed to stand. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KCZaNabd5a6DdgyIFkTNMmwz1yt", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518315, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | Rbellin | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 7 | 130.132.94.68 | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 8 | Lowellian | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3174, "completion_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 3238}}}

Tomorrow, I'll go through everything as part of #2. Nothing in particular looks like original research, but I suppose we'll see. The biggest concern I have in advance is the quality of the references; I can see a few occasions where you've referenced about.com and tripod.com, so it'll depend on the context whether I think they need sorted. On the surface though, it certainly doesn't look problematic.\nWith regards to the two MoS sections above which I haven't yet struck through (italics and diacritics), I'll need to go through the article in detail to check everything. Again, it's something I'm likely to leave until tomorrow. If I do find any instances you've overlooked, I can probably just fix them myself.\nRE: the origin of the red sash \u2014 ah well, if you don't know, you don't know. Better to omit these details until proper confirmation can be found, rather than guessing. I had a Google around myself and couldn't find anything either. You're not limited only to online sources, though. What I might recommend is that you contact the FPF directly and see if they can assist. Of course, you can't cite an e-mail reply, but if they can give you the answer, they can maybe also give you a source to support you as well, or at least point you in the right direction. Of course that would take time and is beyond the scope of the GA review, but you might want to think about it if you ever want to get this article promoted to Featured status in the future.\nAlso, I found ''Football in the Americas'' in a Google Book search which a local library might be able to get hold of. And I've e-mailed someone on the Isle of Skye, in an attempt to contact the author of ''A Statistical History of Football in Peru'' on your behalf. That's a long shot, but you never know what'll turn up. ;)\nThere's no need for me to explain the ref tags\u2014what you did with citations #13 and #20 is exactly what I meant. It's not the way I'd always do it, but for uncontroversial statements, it stops the \"overload\" of references. Regards, ''  '' |\n| 2 | MarshalN20 | I've contacted the FPF, but I'm not sure they will reply to my questions. I've tried to do all of the italics and diacritics that you mentioned, but I can't certify that there are more or that there are none. Thanks for the books. I'll probably have to buy them as my local library is horrible at having these kind of things (nobody cares about football where I live; you can probably guess which country that is). As for the FIFA World Cup section, I will make the table into a single column (like in the Scotland article); but I cannot do the same for the Copa America section since it would really stretch the article down. As for the templates, this might sound really dumb but I do not know what a \"nested\" template is (I'll try to figure it out, so if you read this and see that I have not nested the templates then it's probably because I did not figure it out). Thanks again for the suggestions, I'll next attempt to take this article into an \"A\" class status; of course, that's hoping it first passes this GA review. |\n| 3 | MarshalN20 | \"Failing that, the tables at Brazil national football team#Competitive record seem more standardized across various articles.\" I'll follow the method of the Scotland article. Even though you're right that other articles have a different and more standard section, I believe this might be one of the reasons the Scotland article is FA and the rest are not. Aside from that, I think that I nested the templates (not really sure if it's right). |\n| 4 | DeLarge | Nested templates are where one parent template contains multiple child templates, and collapsing the parent means all the templates are hidden. It's done to minimize the amount of space the templates take up.\nThere's examples at Help:Template#Nesting templates, or I could point you towards , a nested template used on Mitsubishi Motors. It's a personal preference whether or not you want all the templates to be visible, but I felt that while most of the links are red, it's as well keeping the templates' impact to a minimum.\nI've been told by the author that the book isn't available, though he offered to help with specific queries I might have. I've e-mailed a reply to see if he knows anything about the strip design, but it's probably a long shot. ''  '' |\n| 5 | MarshalN20 | That's good. Hopefully we'll get some information on the matter of the shirt (I would really like to know this too). Thus far I've nested the templates and done the chart fixes in the FIFA World Cup section. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KCfYpqYbzdklKS52gWTRZZFxCbD", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518321, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | DeLarge | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | MarshalN20 | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 3 | MarshalN20 | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 4 | DeLarge | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | MarshalN20 | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3667, "completion_tokens": 85, "total_tokens": 3752}}}

I'd like to poll editors to establish whether a consensus might already exist.  First thing to do is to establish the options, and afterward conduct a poll.  Please add options below  \nOption 1 - Military history of the British Isles\nOption 2 - British military history\nOption 3 - Military history of Britain and Ireland\nOption 4 - Create two articles. Military history of Britain + Military history of Ireland |\n| 2 | T\u00f3ra\u00ed | For me, the issue involves to parts of the title: \"Military history of (a)the peoples of the (b)British Islands\".\n(a) The problem with (a) is what does it mean? Does it mean that we are not talking about the military history of states? Are we talking about he military history of ethnicities? Are we talking about the military history of the rise and fall in tribes and groupings? Is the guerrilla military history? What does it mean?\n(b) The problem with (b) is what does it mean? Does it mean the military history of those areas legally defined as the British Islands today? Or all places that have been defined in law as being part of the British Islands at some time in their history? Does it mean the military history of how some parts came to be a part of the British Islands and how some part are no long a part of that entity? Does it mean military conflicts that invovled entities that were at the time of the conflict a part of the British Islands? Do we included military history before the legal term British Islands was coined? Or are we talking about the legal term at all? Do we mean something else? If so what? And why not call it by that name?\nI think the only solution for (a) is to loose it. I think the solution for (b) can be arrived at my simply stating what this article is about. Is it about the military history of Britain? England? The United Kingdom? British Isles/Britain and Ireland (let's leave the naming until after we decide whether it is about this, or not)? Is it about British military history? Once we decide what the article is about, the name will naturally follow.\nWe do have a good starting point. We know this article is about military history. We even know that the contents of the article are. We just need to decide that it is the military history of who or what. rann\u1e57\u00e1irt\u00ed anai\u1e6bnid |\n| 3 | Daicaregos | The article Military history of the United Kingdom already exists. The article History of Ireland already exists. An article named Military history of Ireland could be created, and if you want to do that please go ahead. It is possible (just possible, mind) that not everyone would be in 100% agreement as to what should be included in it. The only realistic option is to delete this article and leave it at that. Yours, |\n| 4 | Bastun | Nicely put, rann\u1e57\u00e1irt\u00ed anai\u1e6bnid.  My opinion is that (a) should go, and that the article should be about the military history of the islands, as opposed to the states.  Re the options above:  1) is fine, and my preference; 2) is already mostly covered by Military history of the United Kingdom ; 3) is fine as it goes, but British Isles is - worldwide - the common term; 4) will lead to unneccessary duplication. |\n| 5 | BritishWatcher | I agree with Bastun. I support option 1, it makes sense to have an article on the British Isles (a term known and used by many despite certain peoples claims), it should cover all periods of history within the British Isles, if we make this to sovereign states then it complicates matters.\n Option two is unacceptable, a better article already exists as mentioned by Bastun, and thats currently where British Military history redirects to.\n (3) would be a reasonable compromise that id accept (its certainly alot better than the current inaccurate title).\n On 4 i would support articles at those locations, but whats the content going to be? Currently this is just a list of different articles, an article at Military history of Britain and Military history of Ireland would be a good idea but it should talk through all the stages in history like Military history of Europe does otherwise a large part will simply be two identical lists. This should just remain a list of all the conflicts of the British Isles (or Britain and Ireland) and the introduction could link to separate articles on Britain / Ireland if someone wanted to make them. Also another problem is at some stage someone may want to create a  Military history of Ireland about the actual country.\n Anyway i support option one, but id accept option 3 if it led to consensus. |\n| 6 | Cyclopaedic | The article (or list, more like) is already hopelessly confused about whether it is listing the history of peoples, political entities or geographical locations. It covers some, but not all, British overseas involvements. It lists fortifications physically in the geographical area, but not British fortifications abroad. I can see no justification for its existence. It should be deleted. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KCqayOTqbFi433UjjyXjFOR0GVd", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518332, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | HighKing | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | T\u00f3ra\u00ed | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Daicaregos | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 4 | Bastun | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | BritishWatcher | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | Cyclopaedic | Cold |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3709, "completion_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 3802}}}

The other sources listed in the article, either don't back up the claim of 45 million, or I have been unable to get ahold of yet. Has anyone seen the article in the Orange County newspaper that's being used as a basis for \"45 million\"? Can someone quote the relevant section even? If no one has seen this article, I think we need to find a better source. I've had one editor claim that the-numbers.com is not a good site for reference but did not give a reason, does anyone else know why this site might be considered unreliable? If there is no reason, I think we would have to move forward either by putting the-numbers.com on the Reliable Sources Noticeboard, and/or using WP:Verifiable as a policy that supports this insertion. Thoughts and flames may now commence! |\n| 2 | David Fuchs | OC-Register: \"In fact, it is the eighth movie in the series, and many Hollywood insiders believe that the $ 45 million \"Star Trek: First Contact,\" which opens Friday, may eclipse even the revered second Trek movie (with Ricardo Montalban as the Corinthian- clad villain) and the popular fourth film, which had a whale of an environmental theme\". Happy now? The Numbers is hardly a great source, and when there are more reliable sources from the actual time the film was made, it's a no-brainer which to use. Once again: just because ''you'' can't find the source doesn't mean it doesn't exist, or someone is making something up.  () |\n| 3 | Despayre | Great! Yup, I'm happy now, and wasn't that easy once you decided to respond to my questions instead of edit war? I did not at any time suggest you made up your source, I only asked you to follow WP guidelines. Seems reasonable. Having said that, one throw-away line in an article hardly seems definitive, especially compared to a source who's only reason to exist is to collect the exact type of data we're looking for. What is your basis for the-numbers not being \"a great source\"? I'm not saying they are, but I don't know of any reason they aren't yet. The difference between 45 and 46 million, imo, isn't that big a gap (but I'll take that extra million if someone offers!), if the-numbers had been off by 5, 10, or more million, I could see the immediate problem with that site. Anwyay, I look forward to reading your reply. Thanks again for pasting that quote. |\n| 4 | David Fuchs | I would trust two print sources from the actual time of the movie over a for-profit online database started a year after the film's release. I can find more, if necessary, but that's rather absurd to have the budget sourced like this.abcd  () |\n| 5 | Despayre | I don't follow your reasoning here...you're saying you shouldn't trust a company that gets paid to have the correct numbers because they started up after the movie was made? That's like saying I can't write a book about Pearl Harbour because I wasn't born yet. I do agree that we do not need 4 sources for this budget though. However, your article from the Toronto Star was not only written before the movie was released (ergo, there's no way they could know the final budget), you also completely mis-read the article. The Toronto Star article only talks about \"Spawn\" being $45 million. The EW cite is about as close to useless as possible, since it doesn't mention numbers, and Berman only confirms the movie has a fair amount of action and doesn't mention any budget numbers (it's the author who makes the assumption using the word \"presumably\" that a larger budget means more action, it could just as easily have been salaries that caused the budget to go up). Further, as I said previously, the line you quoted above from the OC Register is a bit of a \"throw-away line\". As a check, I pulled this article from the OCR (Watchdog Section) today, it says \"A federal judge fined him $1.4 million but waived the fine based on his inability to pay\". However, according to the SEC the judge was \"ordering them to pay disgorgement of $8,974,033 and $1,042,000, respectively, plus prejudgment interest and, based upon their financial conditions, waiving payment of all such amounts.\" So as you can see, there might be a little room for improvement on the OC Register's number accuracy. I'm NOT saying it's not a source we can use here, but I AM saying it's certainly not the be all/end all of numbers. Consequently, I am going to remove your invalid Toronto Star reference and re-insert the-numbers. Which btw, was agreed to as a reliable source here. I'd be completely in favour of removing that EW reference too, but if you think it adds something that's missing from the article, I don't have a problem with it being there, I just don't see a reason for it.

That's like saying I can't write a book about Pearl Harbour because I wasn't born yet. I do agree that we do not need 4 sources for this budget though. However, your article from the Toronto Star was not only written before the movie was released (ergo, there's no way they could know the final budget), you also completely mis-read the article. The Toronto Star article only talks about \"Spawn\" being $45 million. The EW cite is about as close to useless as possible, since it doesn't mention numbers, and Berman only confirms the movie has a fair amount of action and doesn't mention any budget numbers (it's the author who makes the assumption using the word \"presumably\" that a larger budget means more action, it could just as easily have been salaries that caused the budget to go up). Further, as I said previously, the line you quoted above from the OC Register is a bit of a \"throw-away line\". As a check, I pulled this article from the OCR (Watchdog Section) today, it says \"A federal judge fined him $1.4 million but waived the fine based on his inability to pay\". However, according to the SEC the judge was \"ordering them to pay disgorgement of $8,974,033 and $1,042,000, respectively, plus prejudgment interest and, based upon their financial conditions, waiving payment of all such amounts.\" So as you can see, there might be a little room for improvement on the OC Register's number accuracy. I'm NOT saying it's not a source we can use here, but I AM saying it's certainly not the be all/end all of numbers. Consequently, I am going to remove your invalid Toronto Star reference and re-insert the-numbers. Which btw, was agreed to as a reliable source here. I'd be completely in favour of removing that EW reference too, but if you think it adds something that's missing from the article, I don't have a problem with it being there, I just don't see a reason for it. Footnote, If you'd like a copy of the Toronto Star article, I have a copy available. |\n| 6 | David Fuchs | One person chiming in does not make it a reliable source. I fail to see how an article released ''two days before a films release'' is somehow invalidated. Guess what? We take OCR to RSN, I bet they'd say it's a reliable source too. So don't give me this. I've added another two citations for the budget. Let's see you contest these ones.  () |\n| 7 | Despayre | How many chimes would make you happy? Ya, I get that you fail to see that, kinda like you failed to see your article doesn't talk about the movie's budget, at all? Of course you can take OCR to RSN, if you would read before shifting your fingers into gear, you'd see I already said \"''I'm NOT saying it's not a source we can use here''\", so, since I'm not arguing that point, I'm curious what you would gain from that, so don't give me that either please. And as agreed on previously, we don't need 4 citations. I don't know why you are so confrontational about this, it sure does seem to be against the spirit of WP:AGF, WP:OWN and WP:COOPERATION. I think if we can both drop all the snippiness here, we're aiming for the same goal aren't we (The most accurate, informative page about this movie, without unnecessary fluff, written well)? |\n| 8 | David Fuchs | Spare me the lectures and the alphabet soup, and I'd be much happier; spare me your blithe hypocrisy, and I'd be even more so.

Wikipedia is not paper!) but \"should Wikipedia include this specific information, which appears to many editors to be biased, misrepresentative, and misleading concerning iridology and its leading practitioners today?\" to which \"Yes!  Wikipedia is not paper!\" becomes a less convincing response to me.  Of course, Sam is free to disagree with me (and by now, what can I do but expect such a thing? ;-), but I hope that Sam will agree that his remarks are too hasty and inapplicable to serve as conclusive argument here.  Sam likely does have an excellent point (he often does) and I look forward to its being expressed here. |\n| 8 | Sam Spade | there isn't a very good argument in favor of the Iridology article itself, outside of the above. It is a fringe science. I have discussed it with a medical  proffessional who knew of it, and they seemed to find it humerous at best. On the other hand, yes your reference to the streets of london is a perfect explanation. I'd like to have an in depth article on every person, living and dead. Maybe even have a dna blueprint for alot of them. I don't see why we should draw the line on fringe science, so long as it is clear that is what they are. Do you honestly think Waniek & Co. is unqualified a Iridologists? How could anyone be? Are their schools for this? It isn't recognized as a medicine legally in the US, and so I would assume no liscensing is necessary. Is there a liscense for a Iridology in romania? Honestly, I prefer to get as much information as possible from as many sources as possible. It is really best to require the accuser to present the evidence. You accuse mr. waniak of being unqualified, but what is a qualified Iridologist? A snake oil sales man? A hypnotiost? just what are the qualifications you'd like to have proved? Will mr waniak have to cure you of something? I'm already following the Iridology program (minus the light in my eyes part) as best as I can tell, so maybe I'm a qualified Iridologist ;) 'Wiki is not paper' is important to point out w silly extraneous articles like this one, and 'deletionism '''is''' anti-wiki', because the point is to ad to, repair, rewrite, produce more content. Simply deleting alone is anti-thetical. You must ad content as well, and prove your case with citations and facts. Personally, I'd love to see it investigated. I s their a romanian wikipedian who would be willing to look into mr waniak in person, ring him up and examine his creditials?

This claim has been partially substantiated by Vincenzo Di Spazio, \"At the end of the 1980s, an evocative hypothesis was advanced on the part of iridologist and chronobiologist Dr. Dan Waniek, who postulated a non-visual function of the eye which he referred to as \"Functio ocularis sistemica\" (PHOS).\" (2000) ' |\n| 2 | Sam Spade | I have not seen any convincing reason for removing these facts, which are quite helpful to those researching this topic (which would apparently be theresa knot, mr. waniek and adam, and prob nobody else ;) |\n| 3 | 192.94.73.4 | Indeed, if this is verifiable I can't see how it would hurt the article in general.User:192.94.73.4 |\n| 4 | DavidWBrooks | The concern is that wikipedia could be used to provide the appearance of legitimacy where it may not be warranted. It's a tough issue, since it often involves judgement calls, but I think we should err on the side of caution - if there are serious questions, leave it out. After all, there are people out there who have spent 20 years studying alien abductions and \"NASA's faked moon landing\" and have developed evocative hypohteses by the boatload, but we don't give each one of them a paragraph (at least, I hope not) - |\n| 5 | Sam Spade | we should. |\n| 6 | Nunh-huh | While your basic point (the utter unimportance of the information in question) is well taken, including it would harm the article in the same way that listing the batting averages of Little League Baseball players in an article about baseball would be: it suggests it is important information, and it is not. It distracts from understanding: it does not add to understanding. An article should not be composed of trivia: it should be a review of what is important, rather than a collection of what is unimportant. - |\n| 7 | Jwrosenzweig | Multiple points.  1) \"Deletionism\" is seen as anti-Wikipedia by some; others feel it is important to maintain standards.  2) Asking for the removal of information that many editors feel is misleading and substantially too unimportant to merit inclusion in this article (or really any article other than perhaps one on Waniek & Co.) is not necessarily deletionism.  3) The belief that Wikipedia is not paper is important to keep in mind in many situations, although I would submit that it does not demand that Wikipedia become a repository for all things that have ever happened (one might envision thousands of articles devoted to every house number in London and the names of every family ever having inhabited that dwelling....though of course certain addresses, such as 10 Downing Street are excellent examples of possible exceptions)  indeed, the question is not \"should Wikipedia include things not in EB?\" (to which we should reply \"Yes!  Wikipedia is not paper!) but \"should Wikipedia include this specific information, which appears to many editors to be biased, misrepresentative, and misleading concerning iridology and its leading practitioners today?\" to which \"Yes!  Wikipedia is not paper!\" becomes a less convincing response to me.  Of course, Sam is free to disagree with me (and by now, what can I do but expect such a thing? ;-), but I hope that Sam will agree that his remarks are too hasty and inapplicable to serve as conclusive argument here.

Firstly, I'd like to point out a common misconception regarding list articles; it is perfectly possible for bands to appear on multiple \"genre lists\". For example, Dissection can happily appear on the list of death metal bands, the list of melodic death metal bands and the list of black metal bands, as long as reliable sources (e.g. from professional journalists) are provided. In fact, as part of a compromise following a previous discussion, we included the line \"The list includes bands that have been described as nu metal by professional journalists at some stage in their career\" in the intro to this article. The sources provided for the supposedly contentious inclusions here all pass WP:RS easily, but more on them later. A more important aspect of 's edits to this article (and others) is that they do not seem to recognise the term \"nu metal\" as a legitimate genre classification... see for example deletion attempts here and here. However, these all ended in speedy closes as a cursory look Google Books reveals numerous published books dedicated to the genre, including the likes of Tommy Udo's ''Brave Nu World'' (which  claims I have been misquoting; of which more later) and Joel McIver's ''Nu Metal: The Next Generation of Rock and Punk''. The term is also frequently used by ''Kerrang!'', ''Metal Hammer'', ''Guitar World'' (which has a whole book dedicated to it, including System of a Down and Incubus, two supposedly contentious inclusions, found ), MTV, ''Stylus Magazine'' and many others.\nRegarding specific references,  claims that the sources don't say what they do in fact say. They initially claimed for instance that Tommy Udo was \"an obscure author\" whose journalistic credibility is presumably in question, despite having written for ''Sounds'', ''City Limits'', ''The Guardian'', ''Uncut'', ''Bizarre'', ''Metal Hammer'' and the NME. His book ''Brave Nu World'', (ISBN 1-86074-415-X, Sanctuary Publishing) is explicitly about the nu metal genre. Whilst  claimed \"The books refer to late-1990s alternative rock in general\", the sleeve of the book states \"Veteran rock journalist Tommy Udo takes a long hard stare at nu metal through the eyes of the playas, the skaters, the whiggers, the wannabes and the detractors\". Fairly unambiguous. Looking inside the book Udo makes is clear what he is defining as nu metal and what he is not. The bulk of the book is devoted to chapters on specific bands (namely Korn, Limp Bizkit, Staind, Linkin Park, Deftones, Slipknot and Kittie). Chapter 9 is entitled \"The Second Wave and the New Nu Breed: Tomorrow's Major Players\" (pp.148-199). It opens, \"As well as major players like Korn and Limp Bizkit, nu metal has produced a strong second wave of bands who are less obviously in the rap-metal mould, and who appeal to a smaller and more defined fanbase.\" It continues, \"There is a veritable plethora of second-wave bands, ranging from the good (Dry Kill Logic, Ill Nino, Papa Roach, (hed) pe) to interchangeable clones of the more successful players.\" He then proceeds detail a number of bands he sees as being the major players in this \"second wave of nu metal\", specifically Godsmack (pp.149-152), Static-X (pp. 153-159), Spineshank (pp.159-163), Orgy (pp.163-166), Papa Roach (pp.166-169), Incubus (pp.169-172), Mudvayne (pp.172-174), (hed)pe (pp.174-175), Deadsy (pp.176-177), Adema (pp.177-79), Apartment 26 (pp.179-180), Glassjaw (pp.180-182), Taproot (pp.182-183), System of a Down (pp.183-185), Dry Kill Logic (pp.185-186), Crazy Town (pp.187-188), Will Haven (pp.188-190), Puddle of Mudd (pp.190-191), Cold (pp.191-193), Ill Nino (pp.193-194), Disturbed (pp.194-195), Sevendust (pp.195-196), Coal Chamber (pp.197-199). Again, fairly unambiguous. It's made even clearer by the next chapter which discusses bands occasionally associated with nu metal but are not in the author's eyes (e.g. Marilyn Manson, Kid Rock etc.). Udo goes on at the end of the book to list what he regards as nu metal \"essential listening; he includes SOAD's ''Toxicity'', (hed)pe's ''Broke'', Incubus' ''Morning View'' and the Snot/various artists ''Strait Up |\n| 2 | Sugar Bear | My \"history\" is not particularly relevant to your behavior and adding sources which don't back up what is cited.

You're putting words in the writers' mouth by assuming that every band included in that book is a \"nu metal\" band, when perhaps they are only included because the books discuss late '90s alternative rock/metal, punk and rap metal-type bands, and a lot of these bands toured together regardless of what musical style they performed. (  ) |\n| 5 | Blackmetalbaz | Did you read the (admittedly very long) paragaph above? It states ''on the sleeve'' that he is talking specifically about nu metal, not \"'90s alternative rock/metal\"... to quote again: \"Veteran rock journalist Tommy Udo takes a long hard stare at nu metal through the eyes of the playas, the skaters, the whiggers, the wannabes and the detractors\". I'm not going to cut and paste again, but I refer you to the direct quotes above regarding the chapter on the \"second wave of nu metal\"; all bands specifically mentioned in there are obviously inlcuded under the term, and ditto for all bands featured on a list of \"nu metal essential listening\". |\n| 6 | Sugar Bear | Stop pretending that this is an actual genre when there is zero evidence of this. These books cover late-90s alternative rock/rap-rock type bands. \"Nu metal\" was used as an umbrella term for any form of music that rock journalists couldn't easily categorize as rock, hip hop, or heavy metal. (  ) |\n| 7 | Blackmetalbaz | Aha! And we finally get to the nub of the matter! You don't recognise \"nu metal\" as a genre. Fair enough. I suggest you put the nu metal article up for deletion then -). As it stands there are thousands of references for the term, and several books dedicated to the subject, so that's a losing battle, I fear, but one to fight over on that article, not this one. |\n| 8 | Rockgenre | Nu metal, not real? A book with nu metal in the title is not about nu metal? Blackmetalbaz is right here. There is definitive proof that nu metal was a style and just because you don't like the term, that doesn't mean it never happened. |\n| 9 | Sugar Bear | The both of you look like fools for trying to back up claims with citations that don't say what you claim they back up. I want to make this as clear as possible: ''stop trying to misuse sources''. Seriously. Keep this crap up, and both of you will wind up banned.

These included the prevention of the right of return, the destruction of some 400 Arab villages (Morris 1987), and the expropriation of some 50 to 60 percent of the land owned by Arabs who remained in Israel (Kedar 1998).'' |\n| 7 | Ravpapa | Well, it seems you are right about Yiftachel, then. But I still contend that he is wrong. If you read the statements of Israeli leaders then and now, they never mention prevention of the return of refugees as a motive for Judaization. They always say they are trying to create a Jewish majority, and to block Arabs from expanding their villages to \"state-owned\" land. In other words, the policies were aimed specifically to discriminate against the Arabs who remained within Israel's borders.\nAnd, incidentally, if you read Zakour's remarks here, you will see that he says the same thing. He laments the fact that the public debate is always about the refugees and the West Bank, and those Palestinians who stayed behind and suffered from the Judaization policies are forgotten.\nIt's not so much an error as a matter of emphasis - we need to emphasize that the true target of Judaization is the indigenous Arab population. |\n| 8 | Tiamut | I understand what you are trying to say, however, I think Yiftachel is using the issue of Palestinian refugees and the expropriation of their lands as the point of departure. If you read for example pages 137-139 here , you will see how he starts with the expropriation of refugee lands.

Yiftachel may or may not be a reliable source, but in this (if he is being paraphrased correctly) he is wrong.\nThe Judaization policy was, and is today, aimed at Palestinian residents of the Galilee (and the Negev), and not at the prevention of a possible return of refugees. Deputy foreign minister Danny Eilon (Israel Beitenu party) recently stated this clearly:\n\"...We are losing the Galilee and the Negev. There are many areas there without a Jewish continuum, and there are attempts to steal ownership of Jewish land, and to introduce factions that are not Zionist and do not support Israel... The focus today must be Judaization of the Galilee and the Negev.\" (\"Eilon: 'We are losing the Negev and the Galilee'\", Arutz Sheva, Dec 22, 2009)\nIn other words, the policy has, and has always had, two objectives: to create a Jewish majority in the region, and to prevent the geographic expansion of Arab villages. |\n| 2 | Ravpapa | Later: I didn't realize I could read the Yiftachel citation online. I think that much too much emphasis has been put on his one throwaway sentence about the refugees. Yiftachel states clearly that the planning rationale of the Judaization policy was twofold: \"(a) a skewed (Jewish) population pattern existed at the time, with 70 percent concentrated in a few coastal cities, and (b) services and opportunities were lacking for the hundreds of peripheral villages, and new towns were needed to bring these closer to the rural population>\" (p. 120) |\n| 3 | Jaakobou | No surprise that just his exceptional claim was quoted out of the full analysis. If Wikipedia was properly constructed beurocracy-wise, the editor involved would have been forced to give some answers. '''' |\n| 4 | Nableezy | And you would have long since been banned. '''''' - |\n| 5 | Tiamut | Ravpapa, Oren Yiftachel discusses the relationship of Judaization to the Palestinian refugee problem in most of his works on the subject. For example:\nIn ''The struggle for sovereignty: Palestine and Israel, 1993-2005'', he writes  ''The territorial restructuring of the land has centered an expansionist Judaization (de-Arabization) program adopted by the nascent Israeli state. The flight and expulsion of cloe to 800,000 Palestinian refugees during the 1948 war created large \"gaps\" in the geography of the land, which the authorities filled with Jeiwsh migrants and refugees. The Judaization program was premised on a hegemonic myth cultivated since the rise of Zionism that the land (''eretz yisra'el'') belongs solely to the Jewish people. An exclusive form of territorial ethno-nationalism \"indigenized\" immigrant Jews and concealed or marginalized the prior Palestinian presence.''\nIn another essay in ''Rethinking ethnicity: majority groups and dominant minorities'' that Yiftachel co-authored with As'ad Ghanem, they write  ''In the next five decades, Israel absorbed some 2,7 million Jewish refugees and immigrants, and prevented the return of the Palestinian refugees [...] Following independence, Israel began a concerted and radical strategy of Judaization. The expulsion and flight of Palestinian refugees created large 'gaps' in the geography of the land, which the authorities were quick to fill with Jewish settlements. This stratefy also entailed the destruction of over 400 Palestinian-Arab towns, villages and hamlets (Falah 2003).'' He continues on to describe Judaization as accompanied by de-Arabization.\nIn other words, the idea that I somehow misrepresented Yiftachel's position or gave undue weight to one of his explanations for Judaization is simply wrong, as shown by a review of his work. Indeed, he is not alone in this opinion either., But to be on the safe side, I carefully atttributed this idea to him. In any case, should anyone wish to rephrase the material in a way that they believe more accurately represents what he is saying in many works on this topic, please do go ahead. Removing or downplaying the information is inappropriate however given its prominence in Yiftachel's work. |\n| 6 | Tiamut | As for other authors who make the same point as Yiftachel, as explicitly, ther is Haim Yacobi, who writes in the introduction to ''The Jewish-Arab city: spatio-politics in a mixed community''  ''The Judaization and de-Arabization of space employed a range of strategies, which followed the flight and eviction of Palestinian refugees in 1948. These included the prevention of the right of return, the destruction of some 400 Arab villages (Morris 1987), and the expropriation of some 50 to 60 percent of the land owned by Arabs who remained in Israel (Kedar 1998).'' |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KDnkevnh7ifEiw8obHV1mloUnzL", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518391, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ravpapa | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Ravpapa | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 3 | Jaakobou | Cold |\n| 4 | Nableezy | Cold |\n| 5 | Tiamut | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | Tiamut | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3684, "completion_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 3777}}}

Hempl, Miss Stawell and Faucounau didn't use ''the same method'', but mainly the ''same starting hypothesis concerning the language (i.e. Homeric)''. Hempl and Miss Stawell reached these hypotheses in an intuitive way, J.Faucounau by probabilistic calculationS. This is why they don't read the glyphs the same way... You should carefully read J.F.'s books and papers, so you would avoid writting stupid things, like T.Timm (another quick reader!) who pretends that J.F. used the acrophonic method ! As a complement, yes! Not as a starting hypothesis ! (User 80.90.57.154, 200:24, 2 March 2006).\n \nAnswer:\nStawell starts: \"''Last Jaunaury (1911) there appeared in Harpers Magazine an essay by Proffesor Hempl, ... we who follow follow reap the advantage of his labour, ...''\"\nFaucounau starts his book from 1999: \"''A la m\u00e9moire de Florence Melian Stawell qui pressentit, la premi\u00e8re, la solution de l'\u00e9nigme.''\"\nAs 80.90.xx.xx says himself, all have started with the same hypothesis concerning the language.\nBetween two of them there is a subset of symbols with a similar meaning or interpretation. For instance Hempell and Stawell start in A I with \u0391/\u03b1. Stawell and Faucounau interpret sign 20 in error as \"drinking vase\". This error goes back to Evans. At earlier photographs of the disc a handle was visible for sign 20. After cleaning the disc the handle disappeared.\nFaucounau did not publish any probabilistic calculations. |\n| 2 | Dbachmann | I have taken a closer look at JF's decipherment now. He is not as clueless about Greek as I had suspected earlier. However, for a mathematician, his \"statistical proofs\" are disconcertingly naive. His billions to one probabilities are, of course, the chance that a random reading of the text turns out to make as much sense as his. We'll all grant him that his \"decipherment\" makes more sense than what you'd expect of one of the 1080 or so possible readings chosen at random. Let's grant him that his decipherment is 1020 better than expected by chance. That means that he may have found one of the 1060 best solutions (only one of which is of course correct). The other thing is his proud conclusion that his decipherment forces us to reconsider most of what we know of Bronze Age history and linguistics, not recognizing, apparently, that it was rather he being forced to bend some very well established facts in order to justify his reading. This is not so much a sensational outcome but a glaring weakness. The most hilarious part of the book I find the identification of the lost \"monkey\" and \"turtle\" glyphs ) The bottom line is that he is a brilliant riddle solver, and I do feel the tragic quality of the 25 years he spent on this.  \n(note, my value of 10**80 is an estimate for the (45 100) binomial coefficiant, viz., assign 45 values from a pool of, say, 100 syllables.

He's acting like someone who genuinely thinks the place will fall apart without him and we should all be grateful to have him here, and he needs to be away for long enough to see that ''nobody's'' presence or absence makes any significant difference. It's a lesson some learn quicker than others, and if he's telling the truth about that \"twelve hours a day, seven days a week\" that's not a hobby, that's a disorder.\u00a0\u2013 :::PS. I'll also add to you (Malleus) that you really do need to take on board what NYB is saying there. Regardless of who's in the wrong this time, there ''is'' a reason the Civility Police watch you. Remember that rant of mine a few months ago about why the civility policy doesn't work because of cultural differences? It cuts both ways; yes, west-coast Americans are generally hypersensitive about things which wouldn't even register on the radar in Bolton, Boston or Brisbane, but ''you know that''. There's no point antagonising people for no reason, if there's an easy way to reword whatever you were about to say that won't offend them. (To take a comment from that Joseph Merrick discussion above, \"retarded\" is an absolutely standard term in the US, but we don't use it on Wikipedia because it has offensive connotations in Britain.) Giano said long ago that the best way to approach Wikipedia is to assume everyone is 14 years old, and it's good advice; try not to say anything you wouldn't say to a 14 year old whom you don't know very well.\u00a0\u2013 |\n| 6 | Malleus Fatuorum | Perhaps unsurprisingly, I don't entirely agree with Newyorkbrad's assessment, although I'm certainly not about to call him \"a corrupt SOB\". In fact I don't recall ever having called another editor corrupt; what I have said repeatedly is that I believe the ''system'' to be corrupt, and that's not about to change until the system does. And to label me as \"consistently uncollaborative\" is a joke beyond mere words. Besides, I've come to accept it as inevitable that those who either can't or won't look beyond the ends of their noses to see what's really wrong with this place will inevitably succeed sooner or later in driving me away. I can't do anything about that. |\n| 7 | Iridescent | Meh. There can be a difference between being seen as standing up for what you believe in, and dog in the manger. I'm no great fan of NYB but his heart's in the right place, and most importantly he's one of those who understands what he is and isn't good at. What he ''is'' good at is reading the undercurrents of popular opinion. The point he and I are both trying to make is that you not understanding why people get offended (or understanding but not changing) can be seen by some not as integrity, but as the same kind of \"I'm so important everyone else has to change to accommodate me\" thinking that Rod's guilty of. People looking at this from the outside aren't necessarily familiar with the background; if they're not familiar with the background (and let's face it, who the hell reads wiki_link?) it looks like two people being as bad as each other.\u00a0\u2013 |\n| 8 | Malleus Fatuorum | Look, I recognise that I'm being ticked off by the headmaster, but I've never laid claim to being important here on wikipedia. On the contrary, I recognise that it'll do just fine without me. Or you. Or Newyorkbrad. In the meantime, I'll continue to do what I can, or whatever takes my fancy, but I will ''not'' stand for bullying on my talk page, from ''anyone'', whatever the price.

He is not as clueless about Greek as I had suspected earlier. However, for a mathematician, his \"statistical proofs\" are disconcertingly naive. His billions to one probabilities are, of course, the chance that a random reading of the text turns out to make as much sense as his. We'll all grant him that his \"decipherment\" makes more sense than what you'd expect of one of the 1080 or so possible readings chosen at random. Let's grant him that his decipherment is 1020 better than expected by chance. That means that he may have found one of the 1060 best solutions (only one of which is of course correct). The other thing is his proud conclusion that his decipherment forces us to reconsider most of what we know of Bronze Age history and linguistics, not recognizing, apparently, that it was rather he being forced to bend some very well established facts in order to justify his reading. This is not so much a sensational outcome but a glaring weakness. The most hilarious part of the book I find the identification of the lost \"monkey\" and \"turtle\" glyphs ) The bottom line is that he is a brilliant riddle solver, and I do feel the tragic quality of the 25 years he spent on this.  \n(note, my value of 10**80 is an estimate for the (45 100) binomial coefficiant, viz., assign 45 values from a pool of, say, 100 syllables. The exact number is irrelevant of course, the point is that it is \"billions of billions\" of times larger than mere \"billions\"  ) |\n| 3 | 80.90.39.66 | Once again, you didn't understand correctly what J.Faucounau wrote !..  His ''billion to one'' probability refers to the following problem  \"If someone could determine, '''not using the acrophony''', eleven \"probable phonetic values\", what is the chance that these values ''look as respecting the acrophony, with identifications of the corresponding signs already mentioned by other searchers ?'' This calculation is simple, once you know the list of his \"eleven probable values\" (that he published in a mathematical paper, if I remember correctly). For instance, one, I remember it, was Sign n\u00b0 12, of which the ''probable value'' was (A)S as an ending. Well, this sign has been considered as ''incertain'' by Pernier and Della Seta, as ''a round shied'' by Reinach, Rowe, Stawell, Macalister, Evans and Ipsen, as a ''corn-threshing floor'' by Evans, as ''a city'' by Cuny.  The solution ''round shield'' (''aspis'' in Homeric) fits. Strange indeed, that 1)- the ''shield-solution'' is the majority's opinion  2)- that, if one considers ''incertain'' as recovering 5 ''reasonable not-already-mentioned possibilities'' (what seems a maximum!), the ''probability of finding a correspondance between the ''value resulting from the statistical method'' and one of the ''reasonable identifications'' is only 1/8 , to be compared to 1/60'' (in the supposition there are 60 phonetic signs in the Script). In other words, '''in the hypothesis concerning the language that it has been supposed correct''' (what has already a very small chance by itself!), the probability of finding such a correspondance by mere chance is 1/60, the probability of finding it by having been, even unconsciously, influenced by acrophony is 8/60. You should revise your fancy calculations !... (User 80.90.57.154, 14:00, 3 March 2006). |\n| 4 | LukasPietsch | Kadmos, why are you still engaging this guy in discussion at all? He's currently blocked. Not just for sockpuppeting, but also for 3RR, currently since 1 March for 48 hours. Everything he's been writing here is block evasion. I think we should do something to teach him the lesson that blocks are supposed to be obeyed and not to be routinely ignored. I'd start simply erasing anything he writes on sight, no matter whether it's in articles or on talk pages. This guy clearly believes that as long as he can get a fresh IP every day, the rules are not made for him.  |@) |\n| 5 | Dbachmann | if he ''is'' blocked, you should get an uninvolved admin to re-issue blocks for any IP that he shows up with here, ask for it on WP:AN/I. I was not aware that he is currently under a block for 3RRvio. |\n| 6 | Dbachmann | I understand the argument perfectly well, and I repeat my assertion that it is fallacious because if fails to take into account the effect of extremely large numbers. JF's solution is one \"good\" solution. Out of how many? Hundreds? Thousands? He would have to argue towards a probability of it being better than any other, not just based on its strengths but also on its weaknesses, since every \"solution\" will be extremely improbably good if only its strenghts are considered. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KEGnp0GritOD4oDmV8SQlCQ06tn", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518420, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | Dbachmann | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 3 | 80.90.39.66 | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 4 | LukasPietsch | Cold |\n| 5 | Dbachmann | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | Dbachmann | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3750, "completion_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 3843}}}

In this last measurement, this great cat could reach up to 3.30-3.50 m. Some guy, apparently, don\u2019t have understand this.\nSecond: Barbary lions have been mentioned largely as the largest subspecies of lion, however there is NO ONE REAL evidence of this, and all the records, even skulls measurements, show that they were no larger than present East African lions (Patterson, 2004). So, there is no need to mention them. An East African lion had a maximum total length of c.290 cm between pegs, so it is obvious that ''P. atrox'', with up to 350 cm (11.6 ft) in total length, was much larger than ANY present cat.\nThird: The body mass issue is incorrect again. The maximum body mass estimation from Sorkin (2008) was of 420 kg, which could be real for a very large specimen. However, Christiansen & Harris (2009) estimated a highest weight of 351 kg for the largest specimen in Rancho la Brea (LACMHC 2900-3), which have a condylobasal length of 410.4 mm and a greatest length of 458 mm. The average weight estimated by these last authors is of 255.65 +/- 41.34 kg (average +/- standard deviation).\nPlease take in count this data before any new edition on body size of this species. |\n| 2 | Nicolasticot | You really are hard here. There is just a little problem with the catergorical assumption you made: barbary lion only went extinct in the wild and even more, it was in the 20th century -it is a well known subspecies that is way more known than the american lion: Thru history, Atlas Lion was a present to emperors, kings and sultans. There is plenty about it, in litterature, in pictures, in studies and data. Saying there is no evidence is just bad faith: Panthera Leo Leo, first description along with Panthera Leo and Panthera Tigris, Linneues manuscript, 1758, by Linn\u00e9e.

If the page is forbidden now is not my problem, you can check a week latter and the page will be available, and I can\u2019t put the image of the page as the laws of Wikipedia forbid to publish images of books with copyrights.\nHere is the link again, from the first page.\nhttp://books.google.com.gt/books?id=JaJs5YlW-RIC&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=Patterson+lions&hl;=es&ei;=6GsVTvXdNq600AHQ0ZRi&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;&f;=false\nSo don\u2019t be a liar, the book is in English and is not a bogus source.\nThese entire links are useless for you, as NO ONE of them support your claim. No one mention ANYTHING about the difference of TOTAL length against HEAD-BODY length. Besides, there is NOTHING about your silly claim that Barbary lions are larger, so you are wrong when you try to prove something that don\u2019t understand.\nYou first link is just an amateur book, not even a scientific one. You want a real good book, check \u201cBig cats, kingdom of Might\u201d here in google book. That\u2019s a real scientific book and is in English.\nhttp://books.google.com.gt/books?id=szBm5kPeC-cC&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=tom+brakefield+big+cats&hl;=es&ei;=VmwVTqiNNcG30AGB6u0v&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;&f;=false\nThere are good examples of REAL total length and head-body length of the big cats.\nBy the way, you simple ignore the link of Dr Sunquist book \u201cWild Cats of the world\u201d when are the head-body measurements of tigers. You are ignoring the facts.\nThe second link that you put, mention general data of tiger and the TOTAL LENGTH records, and those measurements are ONLY from Maz\u00e1k (1981), not by all the other people that you mention.\nThe book of Sudipta Mitra had very bad reference about size, as he quotes that Asiatic lions measured 2.5 m in head-body length, which is not true. Two males reported by Heptner & Sludskii (1992) had head-body lengths of up to 195 cm, which means that the total length of those specimens, including tail, was of 275-285 cm. Check the book in Google books to.\nCheck the link:\nhttp://books.google.com.gt/books?id=UxWZ-OmTqVoC&pg;=PA86&dq;=%22Body+length+of+males+about+170+to+180+cm%22&hl;=es&ei;=Jm0VTu3lMqHu0gHro6hQ&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=%22Body%20length%20of%20males%20about%20170%20to%20180%20cm%22&f;=false\nAnd this:\nhttp://books.google.com.gt/books?id=UxWZ-OmTqVoC&pg;=PA93&dq;=%22Body+length+of+adult+males+about+195+cm%22&hl;=es&ei;=fW0VTpn0EoLN0AGoqeV3&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=%22Body%20length%20of%20adult%20males%20about%20195%20cm%22&f;=false\nEven if the link is very long, this shows that you are completely wrong.\nThe document from Nowell & Jackson shows who the measurements most be made, and the HEAD-BODY length don\u2019t include tail.\nIn this link:\nhttp://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Panthera_leo.html\nThe length is of 2.40 to 3.30 m, but there is nothing about Basal Metabolic Rate, that\u2019s a mistake in the web page. Besides, these measurements are OBVIOUSLY total lengths.\nSo you can put 20, 30 or 100 links, but NO ONE of them is mentioning what you are stating here. As matter of fact, you are embarrassing yourself, as you are confusing two different measurements here.

The relevant part of Li's remarks are still quoted: he thinks that the Sakyamuni accusation is a \"smear\", which is what this Wikipedia article thinks too, judging by the myriad of qualifications on Chinese government sources (compared to the liberal and preferential use of Falun Gong sources). Some of these qualifications may be inappropriate, since the Changchun report comes from 1992, long before the \"persecution\". Li's entire quote is just a rant against alleged bureaucratic errors during the Cultural Revolution in general. His opinions about that period shouldn't be quoted because he has no academic qualifications to talk about history that doesn't affect him. |\n| 7 | Colipon | Where possible, Chinese government sources should be corroborated with another RS. There is a lot of propaganda emanating from the state, obviously, as many academics have noted. The issue I take here is that, in the very least, state media presentations of materials pre-persecution is more or less acceptable, and not everything the Chinese gov't publishes on this matter is automatically sinister or part of a well-organized conspiracy, especially prior to 1999 (one 'pet issue' in this regard is the alleged link between Luo Gan and He Zuoxiu, which remains in the main article for no good reason). Much of the propaganda following 1999 is essentially embellished versions of pre-1999 investigative reporting. Like the article notes, many of Li's 'rival groups' did the first 'exposes' of Li and Falun Gong in general. The point is, Li's detractors were numerous and far-reaching prior to the state's propaganda campaign. This inevitably exposes another issue with the content - which is that a 'dichotomy'-style presentation of Li's biography is highly misleading.

Zujine tried to fix this, and Shrigley reverted him for reasons unknown.  I have again tried to fix it such that it actually tells us something useful.\nThe old version seemed focused on the question of whether or not Li changed his date of birth in the government records. But that is not source of the controversy;  Li agrees that he changed the records.  The actual debate centers on the question of whether his purpose was to simply correct the record, or whether he was trying to bolster his spiritual authority and misrepresent himself by aligning his date of birth to that of Sakyamuni.  The Chinese government argues the latter,  and Li argues the former.  This being the case, in my edit I stated clearly that Li did change the government records, and provided his explanation of why he did this.  I left in the background about the Changchun faction, even though I frankly don't see how it helps clarify the issue. I also added a note to explain how the Chinese government has attempted to make use of the birth date change, as that was previously lacking.\nTwo final notes:  Chinese government sources have actually given two dates of birth for Li: July 7 and July 27.  David Ownby notes this discrepancy, and I have also now noted it. Also, the old version relied on primary sources, namely Chinese government websites.  Primary sources should be used with extreme caution in BLP, and this is all the more so when those primary sources are described as propaganda by the reliable sources.  I have removed it in accordance with WP:BLP. |\n| 2 | Sean.hoyland | By \"primary source\" are you referring to the People's Daily Opinion piece. I can understand why an opinion piece might be less than ideal in a BLP despite it being published in a mainstream source but your statement seems to indicate that you believe that government controlled Chinese media should be avoided in this article. That seems like the kind of position that you should verify through the BLP noticeboard. '''''' - '''''' |\n| 3 | Homunculus | Sean,  the reliable academic sources describe all accounts of Li Hongzhi's life from the PRC post-1999 as propaganda. David Ownby writes that all such details, even the mundane ones, are \"obviously state propaganda, produced in the context of the campaign against Falun Gong.\"  Benjamin Penny writes that \"one of the targets of the government\u2019s propaganda was the biography of Li Hongzhi, its founder and leader,\" and elsewhere states \"information about Falun Gong published in the People\u2019s Republic is necessarily part of a negative publicity campaign,\u201d and so should be \u201ctreated with caution.\u201d The People's Daily is included within that category, and is decidedly not a neutral, mainstream source on Falun Gong. It is a primary source, and a highly partisan one at that.  Falun Gong accounts are also primary sources.  The article should rely on quality secondary sources.  I am happy to take this to the BLP noticeboard if you believe that's necessary. |\n| 4 | Homunculus | I see a user has partially reverted, and thus made the section incomprehensible again.  It now reads \"According to Li, his date of birth had been misprinted as one of the pervasive bureaucratic errors of the Cultural Revolution, and he was merely correcting it. He called it a \"smear\" from people trying to destroy him.\"  He called what a smear?  The meaning has been completely lost, yet again.  Also, can someone explain the objection to just quoting Li Hongzhi?  That quote has been used in full in multiple reliable sources, it's not excessively long, and it's the clearest articulation of Li's own position on this.  Paraphrasing the quotations means we risk obscuring or misrepresenting the meaning, and that seems to be what happened here. |\n| 5 | Sean.hoyland | I'm uncomfortable with the blanket exclusion. I see your argument as being analogous to someone arguing that we can't use US State Dept press releases in a BLP about a suspected terrorist. It excludes an important, albeit highly partisan, part of the picture. All governments have enemies that they talk about. These kind of concerns are usually handled on a case by case basis in BLPs. I doubt that this will be a problem in practice though as there are plenty of sources. '''''' - '''''' |\n| 6 | Rigley | A pronoun missing an antecedent is not \"complete loss of meaning\".

Li lives in the United States, but nationality is not defined by place of residence alone, but also by national identity.  I suggest keeping nationality as \"Chinese,\" but listing place of residency as United States. On the citizenship question,  the same editor is writing that Li became a citizen in the 1990s.  This claim is sourced (incorrectly) to Time magazine,  as well as to Reuters (which gives a one line \"Li, a US citizen, ...\"), and encyclopedia Britannica, which curiously states that Li became a U.S. citizen in 1997 and settled in the U.S. in 1998.  I reverted this previously because, according to the preponderance of sources (and better sources),  it's not the case.  Palmer, among others, states that Li settled permanently in the United States in 1998 under an investor immigration status, which granted him permanent residency, but not citizenship.  David Ownby states that Li \"moved to the United States in 1996 but did not received his green card until 1998\" (a green card, in case it's not clear, is for permanent residency, not citizenship). The Time magazine article that was incorrectly used to attribute the claim that Li is a citizen instead states \"Li decided to apply for immigration to the U.S.\" in 1997. As anyone who has ever attempted to navigate the labyrinthine maze of USCIS knows, one does not decide to apply for immigration to the U.S. and mysteriously gain citizenship the same year. Many other sources also state that Li is a permanent resident, not a citizen, and Li himself said this in 1999. If there are no sound objections, I am going to change back to state that Li's nationality is Chinese, and that he became a permanent resident in 1998. |\n| 2 | SH9002 |  |\n| 3 | Homunculus | The most reliable sources on this subject (ie. David Palmer, David Ownby, etc) do not say that Li is a citizen. They say that Li moved to the United States in 1996, and gained permanent residency in 1998. The preponderance of reliable sources on this subject say the same thing.  Needless to say, if Li gained citizenship in 1996 as the Encyclopedia Britannica claims, he would not have sought permanent residency in 1998. The Encyclopedia Britannica evidently made a mistake. It happens; even normally reliable sources are fallible. To the question of \"nationality,\" we evidently have different definitions of the term. You think nationality refers to citizenship.  I think citizenship refers to citizenship.  Nationality can be defined by national or ethnic origin, national identity, residence, or citizenship. In all respects except current place of residence, Li is probably best described as a Chinese national. |\n| 4 | SH9002 | Sorry, the term you used \"the most reliable\" is your POV. The problem is the books or articles your want to mention, are still not valid to us here, what we can see in this conversation is only your opinion. Could you give us a real valid link to the part about what you want to claim? BTW, as we know, citizenship doesn't deny the residency right, any citizen has permanent residency in his country. What you mentioned above, doesn't actually conflict with what the another reliable sources stated that \"Li became/is a U.S. citizen\", unless you could find some sources which could or authorized by law to claim very clearly that \"Li has only the permanent residency in U.S. but not a citizen of U.S.\" to against the other reliable sources noted.To the definition of nationality, e.g. the nationality law of PRC said very clearly, \"Article 9: '''''Any Chinese national''' who has settled abroad and who has been naturalized as a foreign national or has acquired foreign nationality of his own free will '''shall automatically lose Chinese nationality'''.''\", which means Chinese national \u2260 have Chinese nationality, the Chinese nationality could be lost under certain conditions (it's about citizenship), even though e.g. Li is alway ethnic Chinese(ethnic origin wouldn't be changed).

I am quickly realizing that you are neither familiar with the scholarly literature on Falun Gong, nor with immigration processes.  So I will explain one more time.\n Nothing I have said is original research\n My assessment that Palmer and Ownby are superior sources is not my POV. It derives from the fact that they are established experts in this field. They have both written books on Qigong and Falun Gong in prestigious academic presses. By contrast, Encyclopedia Britannica, while a good source, is written by on-staff generalists. If there is a factual disagreement between these reliable sources, we should defer to what the highest quality RS say. In this case, the better sources and the majority of sources say Li obtained permanent residency in 1998.\n You say that Palmer and Ownby are \"not valid\" sources. Care to explain?  The books (not links \u2014 you may actually have to go to a library) are David Palmer, ''Qigong Fever: Body, Science, and Utopia in China'' (Columbia Univerity Press, 2007), and David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China'', (Oxford University Press, 2008).  I already quoted the relevant passages above. But again, these sources (and many others) say that Li moved to the U.S. in 1996 and gained permanent residency in 1998. Specifically, he obtained an investor visa in 1998, giving him permanent residency. They do not say that Li ever sought or gained citizenship.\n If you want more sources that disprove the citizenship claim, look at the TIME magazine article you cited.  It says Li decided to apply for U.S. immigrant status in 1997.  He would not have done that if he was already a citizen of the United States.\n If you know anything at all about U.S. immigration (I suspect you don't), you would understand that one does not go about obtaining permanent residency in a country where one is already a citizen. Therefore, the claim that Li obtained citizenship in 1996 is simply an error, and is inconsistent with the vast majority of reliable sources.\n If a person gains citizenship in the United States, they are no longer referred to as a permanent resident.  These are not generic terms; they refer to one's legal status in the United States. The majority of reliable sources (and Li himself) describe Li as a U.S. permanent resident. If he were a citizen, they would not continue to refer to him as a permanent resident. This is not my opinion. It is a fact.\n You say that \"Chinese is the name of nation\".  Not in any maps I own. In any event, I have little cause for optimism when it comes to convincing you that nationality does not necessarily refer to the name of state in which one resides.

I am quickly realizing that you are neither familiar with the scholarly literature on Falun Gong, nor with immigration processes.  So I will explain one more time.\n Nothing I have said is original research\n My assessment that Palmer and Ownby are superior sources is not my POV. It derives from the fact that they are established experts in this field. They have both written books on Qigong and Falun Gong in prestigious academic presses. By contrast, Encyclopedia Britannica, while a good source, is written by on-staff generalists. If there is a factual disagreement between these reliable sources, we should defer to what the highest quality RS say. In this case, the better sources and the majority of sources say Li obtained permanent residency in 1998.\n You say that Palmer and Ownby are \"not valid\" sources. Care to explain?  The books (not links \u2014 you may actually have to go to a library) are David Palmer, ''Qigong Fever: Body, Science, and Utopia in China'' (Columbia Univerity Press, 2007), and David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China'', (Oxford University Press, 2008).  I already quoted the relevant passages above. But again, these sources (and many others) say that Li moved to the U.S. in 1996 and gained permanent residency in 1998. Specifically, he obtained an investor visa in 1998, giving him permanent residency. They do not say that Li ever sought or gained citizenship.\n If you want more sources that disprove the citizenship claim, look at the TIME magazine article you cited.  It says Li decided to apply for U.S. immigrant status in 1997.  He would not have done that if he was already a citizen of the United States.\n If you know anything at all about U.S. immigration (I suspect you don't), you would understand that one does not go about obtaining permanent residency in a country where one is already a citizen. Therefore, the claim that Li obtained citizenship in 1996 is simply an error, and is inconsistent with the vast majority of reliable sources.\n If a person gains citizenship in the United States, they are no longer referred to as a permanent resident.  These are not generic terms; they refer to one's legal status in the United States. The majority of reliable sources (and Li himself) describe Li as a U.S. permanent resident. If he were a citizen, they would not continue to refer to him as a permanent resident. This is not my opinion. It is a fact.\n You say that \"Chinese is the name of nation\".  Not in any maps I own. In any event, I have little cause for optimism when it comes to convincing you that nationality does not necessarily refer to the name of state in which one resides. So how about we get rid of the 'nationality' field, and instead have 'ethnicity' and 'country of residence' ? |\n| 6 | Homunculus | I re-read your comments, and realized ever more clearly that the problem is that you don't understand U.S. immigration. You seem to believe that there is no conflict between the claims that Li gained citizenship and then obtained permanent residency, because you seem to think that \"permanent residency\" describes a state of living permanently in a place.  I suggest you read Permanent residence (United States). You will discover, as I stated above, that permanent residency refers to a person's legal immigration status. It is a path to citizenship; a person is typically eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship after three to five years of being a permanent resident. Once one obtains citizenship, one is no longer classified as a permanent resident. The most reliable sources writing from the late 1990s onward describe Li as a permanent resident, which implicitly means he is did not gain U.S. citizenship in the 1990s.  I hope that's clear.  I fixed the article again, and just removed the nationality field altogether as an interim solution while this is in dispute. There's no value in having incorrect or even questionable information remain in a BLP. |\n| 7 | Seb az86556 | FWIW, Homunculus is right. \"Permanent resident\" and \"citizen\" are mutually exclusive terms under U.S. law.

BTW, what you announced paper books are not available in every library in the world, e.g. at least,  I can find neither both of these two titles (I've checked) at my local libraries, so can't verify their contents. BUT MOST IMPORTANT, to your mentioned content, we need valid source to support your assumption that \"Li doesn't gained citizenship of U.S.\" directly or explicitly to against those explicit contents \"Li became a U.S. citizen\" or \"Li, a U.S.citizen\u2026\", which available in already founded reliable sources. But what maybe in the books, you cited above, is \"They do not say\u2026\", that's not an evidence to against what the other valid reliable sources stated. Sir, '''\"they don't say so\u2026\" \u2260 \"they said that isn't so\u2026\"''', these are two different expressions for the total different semantics.

The reverse is true also: if the article topics are sourced to reliable sources which indicate something important and positive, the heading labels should reflect that.\nCompare \"Contaminated soil\" to \"Water quality improvements.\" Given that sources accurately demonstrate these topics in the article text under those headings, these heading are preferable to alternative headings such as \"Soil description\" or \"Water description\" because they are more accurate.\nTwo circumstances would justify the removal of the \"anti-\" in the headings. 1) Requires that reliable sources stating the tracts were accurate in their treatment of the subject of the headings be included in the text under the subject headings. 2) Requires other reliable sources be cited in the text under the headings which state that these other sources dispute the ideas published in the reliable sources currently being cited. In either of those circumstances the headings could be changed to read something like \"Dispute over treatment of homosexuality in tracts\" and so forth for other headings.\nIf the section \"Anti-evolution\" is not presenting all mainstream or fringe views with due weight, reliable sources should be cited in the text that present the other views.

In particular, are the heading names neutral, and do sections such as \"Anti-evolution\" present all mainstream viewpoints with due weight and in a neutral tone? |\n| 2 | Ckruschke | Not sure. Chick was obviously violently anti-evolution, anti-homosexual, and anti-Catholic (and anti alot of other things) and went WAY overboard on the way these issues were presented (thus the equally hostile backlash) so thus part of me would say that the section headings are accurate. That being said, if we simply edited out the \"anti-\" in those subject headings, it would be equally descriptive as the topic of the tracts are about \"Evolution\", \"Homosexuality\", and \"Catholicism\". I'm ok with either.   Ckruschke |\n| 3 | PnakoticInquisitor | Overall, it seems NPOV but as Ckruschke noted the \"anti-\"s could be removed to sound less negative. On a different topic, why is \"Further information: Evidence of common descent\" under Anti-Homosexuality? Fixed. '''''''''' |\n| 4 | Ckruschke | Slightly off topic - but in my opinion, this \"Further Info\" doesn't even belong - the article is about Chick Tracts so evolution itself is only a peripheral topic.   Ckruschke |\n| 5 | Siafu | Surely the two of you have heard of WP:BEBOLD? |\n| 6 | BruceGrubb | True but they have also likely heard of WP:FRINGE which Chick tract's most definitively fall under.  WP:FRINGE states \"The neutral point of view policy requires that all majority and significant-minority positions be included in an article. However, it also requires that they not be given undue weight\"\nBoth WP:NPOV and WP:UNDUE require reliable sources.  In fact, WP:UNDUE is quite clear on the matter: \"Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints '''that have been published by reliable sources, ''in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint'''''.\nIf Chick Tracks are called Anti-Catholic, Anti-Homosexuality, and Anti-evolution by the overwhelming majority of reliable sources then per WP:UNDUE we canNOT invoke WP:NPOV regarding the section titles. |\n| 7 | Factseducado | As the article stands currently NPOV is being abided by.

Instead if article topics are sourced to reliable sources which indicate something important and negative, then the heading label of the topic in the article should reflect that. The reverse is true also: if the article topics are sourced to reliable sources which indicate something important and positive, the heading labels should reflect that.\nCompare \"Contaminated soil\" to \"Water quality improvements.\" Given that sources accurately demonstrate these topics in the article text under those headings, these heading are preferable to alternative headings such as \"Soil description\" or \"Water description\" because they are more accurate.\nTwo circumstances would justify the removal of the \"anti-\" in the headings. 1) Requires that reliable sources stating the tracts were accurate in their treatment of the subject of the headings be included in the text under the subject headings. 2) Requires other reliable sources be cited in the text under the headings which state that these other sources dispute the ideas published in the reliable sources currently being cited. In either of those circumstances the headings could be changed to read something like \"Dispute over treatment of homosexuality in tracts\" and so forth for other headings.\nIf the section \"Anti-evolution\" is not presenting all mainstream or fringe views with due weight, reliable sources should be cited in the text that present the other views. Then the article heading could be changed to read, \"Dispute over treatment of evolution and creation in tracts.\" |\n| 8 | Elizium23 | I am closing this RFC early, as consensus seems fairly clear.

Although usually discounted by historians, oral tradition plays a major role in the Islamic understanding of Muhammad. Although usually discounted by positivist historians, oral tradition plays a major role in the Islamic understanding of Muhammad, Many of the later Western works, from the 18th century onward, distanced themselves from the polemical histories of earlier Christian authors. These more historically oriented treatments, which generally reject the prophethood of Muhammad, are coloured by the Western philosophical and theological framework of their authors. Many of these studies reflect much historical research, and most pay more attention to human, social, economic, and political factors than to religious, theological, and spiritual matters.

So ''technically'' we don't have a literal copyright violation here.  The problem is that these quotes, when not attributed, count as \"WP:Plagiarism\".  We could legitimately quote that much, with \" \" and appropriate referencing, which of course is not true of an actual copyright violation i.e. longer length.  Nonetheless, it's pretty clear that Wikipedia wants to stay far from plagiarism.  A reason often given, with which I personally disagree, is to uphold its reputation - I don't think that amateur, sometimes non-academic writers actually ''need'' to uphold such a high reputation - however, Wikipedia has a different reason of its own, which is that the content needs to be freely editable and reusable, and there is a risk that if you take an article with 200 unattributed words and add a nice big quote or picture of your own, you start getting into the area where there could be a genuine copyright violation, and there's no way to know that without suppressing the plagiarism.  The point of this tldr pedantry of mine is just to point out that we won't need to suppress edit history or do other copyvio-type responses here, and those at fault should be pointed at the plagiarism policy rather than the copyright. |\n| 8 | Wnt | OK, I've tracked the \"polemical history\" part to a series of edits on July 29, 2008.  The three other bits from the first table above come from there, but the edit mentioned later is older... looks like it came in March 31, 2008 by the same editor, , who was a major contributor to the article.   On the plus side, all these quotes ''were'' sourced directly to EB, and I don't think we even had any rules specifically about plagiarism back then.  But if people want to be thorough they might want to check other sources he's cited for direct copying. |\n| 9 | Moonriddengirl | Good sleuthing on the source. ) But there is no maximum safe word count; I'm afraid that's a common copyright misconception. / See, for instance, , , ,  and even our own article on fair use, which documents a legal case in which copying 300 words from a book was found to be copyright infringement. This is not merely a plagiarism issue; this is an issue under WP:C and WP:NFC, both of which have long required that any content copied verbatim from non-free sources be fully and explicitly marked as quotations. This may have been and very probably was done in all good faith, but I'm afraid that it's still quite probably a copyright problem...especially  because we have reason to be concerned about other sources as well. See , for one more example:\n Our version Source version Source Ali himself was firmly convinced of his legitimacy for caliphate based on his close kinship with Muhammad, his intimate association and his knowledge of Islam and his merits in serving its cause. He told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance (bay'ah) as caliph was based on his belief of his own prior title. He had not changed his mind when he finally gave his pledge to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and to Uthman but had done so for the sake of the unity of Islam, at at time when it was clear that the Muslims had turned away from him. Yet Ali himself was firmly convinced of the legitimacy of his own claim based on his close kinship with the Prophet, his intimate association with, and knowledge of, Islam from the outset and his merits in serving its cause.... He had told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance to him as successor to Muhammad was based on his belief in his own prior title. He had not changed his mind when he finally gave his pledge to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and to Uthman. He had done so for the sake of the unity of Islam when it was clear that the Muslims had turned away from him, the rightful successor of Muhammad.Madelung p. 141\nWe see this kind of thing from time to time - where in all good faith a contributor copies or very closely paraphrases from non-free sources without realizing that this is permitted only in direct quotation.  Looking at the contributor's list of edits to this article, I wonder if the best thing to do here isn't to proactively replace or remove specific contributions by him, unless they can be checked and (where necessary) turned into quotations as appropriate:\n''\n\n'''\n(Not all of these edits will be problematic; this should be a list of content + edits that were not reverted or minor.)

Hopefully we'll all be able to be patient until then. Thanks.  \nHearfourmewesique, if you put your responses in separate posts as requested by Nightscream, I have a request, too.  Could you please quote from the Wikipedia references the sentence(s) contained in the references that I'm accused of violating (or would violate if my contributions are incorporated)?  As I stated in this section earlier today, I have read the Wikipedia references which you cite (which include , WP:COPYVIO, WP:TROLL, WP:POINT, and WP:COMPETENCE), but I am unable to determine where you are able to show support for your comments.  I am not asking for WP:IDIDNOTHEARTHAT (which seems not to apply in our dispute because you haven't shown (1) a rejection of my input by a consensus of the community, and (2) my refusal of acknowledging your input). Thanking you in advance.  \nNightscream's Response\nTHE FIRST SENTENCE\nThe distinction between each versions of the sentence is minor at best, and in my opinion, I see little reason why this had to be such a point of contention. It's the sort of thing each of you should've been willing to compromise on. But if you really need me to split hairs over this, I would suggest that noting how soon before Pinochet's fall the emigration occurred may help readers familiar with Pinochet to get a more precise idea of when Fring's emigration was. This may be even more relevant if Pinochet's fall is directly relevant to the plot line. (Is it?)\nHowever, TelevisionFan says Ref #4 supports this. As of this writing, that source is the Dave Itzkoff ''New York Times'' article, but I'm guessing he meant the episode \"Hermanos\", since that was Ref #4 as of the writing of TelevisionFan's message here. (See, this underscores the need for clarity in discussions like this; naming the source would've been more clear.)\nHearfourmewesique, I'm not quite sure I understand your statement. How does episodecite pertain here?\nFIRST SENTENCE PARAPHRASE\nThe fact that Pinochet's fall is not explicitly mentioned in the quote does not, in itself, mean that it cannot be mentioned, since it's a real-life event whose occurrence is documented. You may not ''have'' to mention the fall, but at the same time, you don't |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KG5gX4w0jam1c2t7PvBetyj9P7m", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518533, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Television fan | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Nightscream | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Television fan | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3809, "completion_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 3864}}}

Here's a restatement of them without the footnotes:\nVersion No. 1\nGus left Chile in 1986, the same year in which the Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Patriotic Front attempted to assassinate Pinochet.  Although there are no existing Chilean records of Gus, there are two instances which demonstrate his likely involvement in the Pinochet government: Hector Salamanca refers to Gus as \"Grand Generalissimo,\" and Don Eladio tells Gus that he is \"not in Chile anymore\" but spares his life because he knows who Gus really is.\nVersion No. 2\nOn September 7, 1986 the Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Patriotic Front attacked Pinochet's car in an assassination attempt. Having been likely connected to Pinochet's government, Gus left Chile in 1986, leaving no traceable records. At one point, Gus is referred to as \"Grand Generalissimo\" by Hector Salamanca in a phone conversation, and during a later altercation, Don Eladio tells him that he is \"not in Chile anymore\" upon sparing his life (which he does namely due to his knowledge of Gus' past).\nWhich is more easily read? Which do you prefer? |\n| 5 | Hearfourmewesique | A small point, Nightscream, to answer one of your queries and point at the larger problem with TF's approach. You asked: \"How does episodecite pertain here?\" When you cite an episode, you rely on the '''episode itself''' as the primary source. TF, however, insists on clinging onto the '''text of the episode's article''' (for example, the verbatim quote \"because he knows who Gus really is\" from Hermanos (Breaking Bad)), which both violates WP:COPYVIO (since you're quoting another Wikipedia editor without the proper attribution, which is always needed, even if it's free) and demonstrates a lack of creativity for a good paraphrase/rewrite, which constitutes the very essence of encyclopedic writing. I would really like to get it over with. I have presented a professional, neat, and smoothly readable version. |\n| 6 | Television fan | Nightscream, I have no problem with removing the reference with the quote \"because he knows who Gus really is[.]\"  With the exception of \"really,\" my colleague is clinging to the phrase that is said above in the \"Character biography\" section.  Notwithstanding any \"fair use\" defense to alleged copyright violations, it seems to me that my colleague is trying to have it both ways  use the quote in one place but not the other.  I don't mind restating the same words intra-article; I place intra-article consistency over a need to paraphrase.  In fact, we could always say \"as stated above\" in the Note (referring to the \"Character biography\" section).\nAlso, which of the following is preferable to you:\nHe was born in Chile and emigrated to Mexico in 1986 during the reign of Augusto Pinochet.\nHe was born in Chile and emigrated to Mexico in 1986, a few years before the fall of Augusto Pinochet.\nHe was born in Chile and emigrated to Mexico in 1986 at the time of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.\nHe was born in Chile and emigrated to Mexico in 1986, four years before the fall of Augusto Pinochet.\nHe was born in Chile and emigrated to Mexico in 1986, four years prior to the fall of Augusto Pinochet.\nHe was born in Chile and emigrated to Mexico in 1986 before the fall of Augusto Pinochet in 1990.\nHe was born in Chile and emigrated to Mexico in 1986 prior to the fall of Augusto Pinochet in 1990.\nAny other hybrid?  I want a fresh set of eyes to make a selection. |\n| 7 | Hearfourmewesique | Just leave the sentence alone. The original one works fine. Nightscream already told you it's all hair splitting.

As far as I can tell, the existence of Jesus is not treated as fact by any peer-reviewed journal of history at all. It certainly isn't common. The sources here are popular books, and most of them are Christian publishing houses. Bart Ehrman's training is in divinity and Bible colleges, and he is not a professor of history. |\n| 2 | VanishedUserABC | It goes back to the question of: \"Is Ehrman using his expertise in the subject?\" or is \"Ehrman using his knowledge of what has been published/stated\". One can debate if Ehrman/ProfessorX, etc. have views which are biased. But the expertise here is knowing the scholars of antiquity and counting. So these are really different issues. And again biblical scholarship is not theology, as the Oxford Handbook states on that page, and New Testament scholars do study history etc. So the \"fact\" discussed here is not the existence of Jesus but a \"count of scholars of antiquity\". So the real question is \"does Ehrman know how to count up to 5?\" |\n| 3 | VanishedUserABC | I should probably make another point here, namely that Ehrman is not the only source stating that and Van Voorst effectively says the same, as do the other sources. Van Voorst's book has received endorsements as the \"best on the topic\" from ''all sides''. A number of other professors recommend Van Voorst, but I was surprised of the endorsement by Richard Carrier who is in the opposite camp. On his blog on July 11, 2012 Carrier reviewed the book \"Is This Not the Carpenter? The Question of the Historicity of the Figure of Jesus\" and criticized the treatment of non-Christian sources by Lester Grabbe in that book. Carrier then said to his readers: \"I would recommend you simply buy and use Van Voorst on this subject\". I was impressed that Carrier recommended van Voorst. So his book is really solid, and well accepted within the field. |\n| 4 | Humanpublic | \"Robert E. Van Voorst (born 5 June 1952) is a Professor of New Testament Studies at Western Theological Seminary, in Holland, Michigan, and has published scholarly works in early Christian writings and New Testament Greek. He received his B.A. in Religion from Hope College in Holland, Michigan, his M.Div. from Western Theological Seminary, and his Ph.D. in New Testament from Union Theological Seminary in New York City. He has served at Lycoming College (Methodist)\" Eerdmans is a Christian publishing house. Are there any academic, peer-reviewed articles? |\n| 5 | VanishedUserABC | Actually WP:RS does not work that way, specially given that Van Voorst is not expressing his own opinion on the existence of Jesus, but doing a headcount of the other scholars. I think you need to read WP:USEBYOTHERS regarding Van Voorst. Try this anyway, then note that on page 510 of his book Understanding the Bible, Stephen Harris states that Van Voorst's book examines all known ancient noncnonical references to Jesus. On page 162 of his book Michael McClymond relies on it, and calls it the best recent discussion on the topic. And on page 154 of his book, after reviewing the historical issues, Craig L. Blomberg states: \"The fullest compilation of all this data is now conveniently accessible in Robert E. Van Voorst, Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence.\" And Eerdmans is an absolutely solid publisher used across Wikipedia as a WP:RS source. I think this is beginning to run into what Ian Thomson called a separate standard now. And again, Van Voorst is ''not'' expressing his own opinion about the existence of Jesus, he is just counting the number of scholars on each side of the debate. Is that clear? His book is acknowledged as the standard reference by atheists and Christians alike.  If there is ''anyone'' who knows all the sources and all the scholars of antiquity on the issue better than the others, it is Van Voorst. So can Van Voorst count up to 5? You tell me... |\n| 6 | Ian.thomson | Plus, there's James D. G. Dunn \"Paul's understanding of the death of Jesus\" in ''Sacrifice and Redemption'' edited by S. W. Sykes (Dec 3, 2007) Cambridge University Press. That's certainly along the lines of academic and peer-reviewed.\nMany of the citations are pretty big names, and shooting them down (or even providing good evidence against the historical existence of Jesus) would advance someone's career. There is a gap in history that (so far) can only be filled if there was a Jewish preacher in Roman Judea about two millenia ago named Yeshua. His exact personality or teachings cannot be known, but the following this individual developed, as Alexander the Great and others developed, leaves the existence of this person as equally unquestioned. Looking for an article in a scholarly journal trying to prove or disprove the historical existence Jesus is like looking for an article proving or disproving the existence of Alexander, Siddhartha Gautama, or Socrates. As with evolution, the existence of those individuals are considered known facts, it's just the exact details that we're trying to perfect.\n(And if anyone wants to consider that OR, the above is pretty much a summarizing paraphrase of the prologue to John Dominic Crossan's \"The Historical Jesus.\") |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KGH4PmkEiuwuwlH7I9JCxm5hIp4", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518545, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Humanpublic | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 2 | VanishedUserABC | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | VanishedUserABC | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 4 | Humanpublic | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 5 | VanishedUserABC | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | Ian.thomson | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3789, "completion_tokens": 102, "total_tokens": 3891}}}

If that is so, why not the Sects of Lingayats, Arya Samajis and maybe even the Kodavas from Coorg? The Coorgis are ancestor worshippers and at the most worship river Kaveri as a deity. Of course present day Coorgis do practice vedic rituals and worship in connection with House warming ceremonies etc. In any case the term 'Hinduism' should include all schools of thought which are 'thought' based and not 'belief' based.  Anyone who thinks about God can be a Hindu and this is why Hinduism accomodates even the atheist in its sweep. |\n| 2 | Vaikunda Raja | But in Akilam it is stated that, as soon as Kali Yukam begins all the Hindu Puranas, Agamas, sashtras had lost their substances. And instead of that the New Scripture is given by God and that is Akilattirattu Ammanai. All the other schools in Hinduism though differ from each others in beliefs or thoughts, they don't say that others were lost or not to be followed. But in Ayyavazhi mostly all the saivite Vashnavite and other scriptures were mentioned but said as lost. If you accept Ayyavazhi inside Hinduism you may have to see with equal value the Akilattirattu Ammanai with other scriptures of Hinduism and if so have to accept that all the others had lost their substance and instead have to accept whole-heartedly Akilattirattu as the supreme ond only scripture.\nApart from these there is also a lot of ideological variations between Ayyavazhi and Hinduism. - |\n| 3 | IAF | Look, there are various movementsts like Ayyavazhi in India, which have a far greater following than it. Examples  Osho, Aryasamajis, Ananda Marg, ISKCON, and a whole galaxy of cults. '''That does not mean that they be granted the status of a religion'''. Period. A few Deemed or undeemed South Indian Universities may recogniz the Ayyavazhi cult, but '''as Ayyavazhi is not recognized as a religion by the Indian Constituion,''' it is merely a Cult, and not a religion. I repeat, Ayyavazhi is a cult, not a religion. Otherwise India will have a few hundred religions and pantheons. |\n| 4 | Venu62 | You might want to see this for the extent of penetration of the Ayyavazhi spam in WP. -  / |\n| 5 | Paul Raj | Ayyavazhi is not recognised as a religion by the Universities. The religions studies from the University says that, the basic of Ayyavazhi is autonomous. Also Universities can't offically recognise a religion. Also if Indian Constitution doesn't recognise Ayyavazhi as a religion, then it is valid in India official matters. Indian Constitution doesn't control Wikipedia. Wiki is an encyclopedia, and it says the basic and expanded structure of Ayyavazhi. And for that, as per wiki guidelines valid sources are used for citation. And that valid sources here used are the Universities and their books. But still the wiki article has to mention the view of Indian constitution. That had already mentioned right in the beggining in every cross reference of Ayyavazhi.\n'''Wiki has to mention the view of India constitution''', But '''the ultimate view of wiki article cannot follow the view of India Constitution'''. So '''''Please understand''''' friend. Thanks. - |\n| 6 | Paul Raj | For example, If smoking is prohibited as per Indian Penal code, we can't write that \"Smoking is a prohibited thing\" in wiki article, but can mention that Indian law prohibites Smoking. The whole article can't be written with a prohibited tone. So pleas edon't delete the contents. - |\n| 7 | IAF | Paul, I must ask what you think of Osho, Aryasamaj, Ananda Mrag and ISKCON. Do you classify them as religions or cults ?

G. Dunn \"Paul's understanding of the death of Jesus\" in ''Sacrifice and Redemption'' edited by S. W. Sykes (Dec 3, 2007) Cambridge University Press. That's certainly along the lines of academic and peer-reviewed.\nMany of the citations are pretty big names, and shooting them down (or even providing good evidence against the historical existence of Jesus) would advance someone's career. There is a gap in history that (so far) can only be filled if there was a Jewish preacher in Roman Judea about two millenia ago named Yeshua. His exact personality or teachings cannot be known, but the following this individual developed, as Alexander the Great and others developed, leaves the existence of this person as equally unquestioned. Looking for an article in a scholarly journal trying to prove or disprove the historical existence Jesus is like looking for an article proving or disproving the existence of Alexander, Siddhartha Gautama, or Socrates. As with evolution, the existence of those individuals are considered known facts, it's just the exact details that we're trying to perfect.\n(And if anyone wants to consider that OR, the above is pretty much a summarizing paraphrase of the prologue to John Dominic Crossan's \"The Historical Jesus.\") |\n| 7 | Farsight001 | Do historians even do peer review or have scholarly journals?  I feel like this is along the lines of what I said earlier - people trying to jam the round peg of history through the square hole of scientific inquiry. |\n| 8 | Ian.thomson | There are plenty of peer-reviewed journals.  Certain things are accepted a little sooner with history because the level of skepticism required for physical sciences would reduce all historical knowledge before the 20th century to maybe a dozen books.  There's also how cross-disciplinary history is.  It's a field that combines linguistics, geography, textual criticism, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and archaeology; and welcoming enlightenment from architecture, chemistry, weaponry, etc, depending on what you're discussing.\nI highly doubt that any of them would have articles trying to prove or disprove the existence of Jesus, anymore than a biology journal would be looking for proof or disproof of evolution these days (it's accepted as fact by the mainstream, it's the details that are being settled). |\n| 9 | HiLo48 | '''POINT OF ORDER''': Is this section contributing anything towards making this a better article?

Do you classify them as religions or cults ? You will automatically get your answer where does Ayyavazhi stand. |\n| 8 | Paul Raj | '''Ananda Marga''' and '''ISKCON''', these two are (may be a religious or social) organisation or movent as per here and as per the name (Krishna Conciouseness Organisatin) itself respectively.\n'''Arya Samaj''' is a reform movement or may be to some extend a sect within Hinduism.\n'''Osho''' page have two dissambiguation. In any of the both cases, they may be a reform movements with in any religion.\nBut don't understand '' 'Where Ayyavazhi stand' '' from knowing all these organisations. And if you compare Ayyavazi with any of these movements or sects, I may say that you are throughly mistaken. Because these are based on Hindu or some other scriptures and may be secular but based on Hindu Structure\n'''ISKCON''' - Based on Bhagavatham and Bagavad Gita.\n'''Arya Samaj''' - Vedas\nThese two are movements or sects based on Hindu scriptures, but may be different view on those from other Hindus.\n'''Ananda Marga''' - Probabily secular (but this was a organisation)\n'''Osho''' - Rajneesh Chandra Mohan Jain a reformer\nThese two are reform movements or organisations.\nAyyavazhi is not based on any other religions. I was telling right from the beggining that they (Ayyavazhi) have seperate independent scriptures. And these scriptures says that the origina vedas were destroyed at the beggining of Kali Yuga and the present day vedas are nothing but which are made by Kaliyan. And also bythe incarnation of Vaikundar, all prevoious Puranas, Agamas, Sastra, etc have gone awry, and Akilam was given as a alternative for that. (i.e)The Ayyavazhi's have seperate scriptures and they don't follow that of Hindus. How do you compare Ayyavazhi with all the above religious movements or sects based on Hindu or other religious structures?\nAlso I can't understand why wiki users are not understanding this simple thing even though I repeate the same, many times. - |\n| 9 | BostonMA | I am not convinced that Ayyavazhi deserves a separate mention.  I believe this may be giving undue weight to the POV that Ayyavazhi is a \"separate religion\".\n First, I am not convinced that the majority of followers of Ayyavazhi consider themselves to be a separate religion.  There is a vocal editor who believes so, but websites devoted to Ayyavazhi seem to contradict him.\n Second, it is not uncommon for a sect to hold the views that\nHindus have religiously gone astray\nThe founder of the sect is an avatar of god\nThe founder has provided new teachings which restore the original essence of Hinduism,\nThus, although followers of Ayyavazhi ''may'' (and I'm not asserting the majority ''do'') believe Ayyavazhi to be a \"separate religion\", this POV is not necessarily the only one that should be considered in Wikipedia, or even given the greatest weight.\nUnfortunately, discussions on this subject tend to be extremely voluminous and not very fruitful.  I would very much like to avoid long discussions about Ayyavazhi on every page in which it is mentioned, and would be grateful for suggestions regarding how to proceed. |\n| 10 | IAF | BostonMA, I agree with you, and this very issue has been discussed previously. Ayyavazhi is not a religion, but a cult because \nIt is highly unknown,\nhas too few followers,\nand is too recent (invention of new religions was stopped after Ba'hai). But some memebrs think it deserves a separate mention. |\n| 11 | Paul Raj | Iam going to speak more not.

Rather, 13.0.0.0.0 is the beginning of the first baktun of the new era, no? (since 13.0.0.0.0 is, in effect, the same thing as saying 0.0.0.0.0). Therefore, shouldn't all references to \"the 14th baktun\" be changed to \"the first baktun of the new era\"? |\n| 2 | Senor Cuete | That makes sense but unfortunately the ancient Maya didn't see it that way. If you read the article you will see that all distance inscriptions, long Reckonings , etc. Use  20 bak'tuns in a piktun.    Senor Cuete |\n| 3 | PL | How many Mayan inscriptions do you know of that give more than 13 in the bak'tuns position? |\n| 4 | Bigzteve | OK, two follow-up questions in that case \u2013\n Since 21 Dec 2012 is considered as the 14th baktun, does that then mean that it is also the beginning of the 2nd Piktun? (Assuming we take the 13 baktun = 1 piktun understanding, rather than the 20 baktun=1piktun)\n And ''if'' 21 Dec 2012 really is the 14th baktun ''and'' the 2nd piktun, then why was 31 Aug 3114 BC also written by the Maya as \"13.0.0.0.0\", and not as \"0.0.0.0.0\"?\nThanks! |\n| 5 | Senor Cuete | You are wrong and you could read this article to answer your question. All inscriptions say that the start of this world occurred on a whole bunch of 13s.13.0.0.0.0. All known inscriptions use 20 bak'tuns in a pictun and there are examples in the article.    Senor Cuete |\n| 6 | PL | To judge by the article, this appears to apply to 'distance numbers' only. Am I wrong? I mean, if the creation click-over date is all 13s, why not 20s? |\n| 7 | Bigzteve | Hi! First of all, Merry Christmas!\nSecond of all - it's not really about \"being wrong\" - I don't actually have an argument either way - I'm interested in understanding what the deal is. I would like an explanation for my two above questions, which you haven't answered, and now you raise more questions - why is the 13.13.13...13.0.0.0.0 creation not mentioned earlier in the article, if it's that important? What's the explanation for this world beginning at such a random number, and what do the Maya say came before that? And how do we therefore define \"world\", and therefore how many \"worlds\" have there been...? And does that mean that we are still living in the 14th piktun of the 14th kalabtun, etc...?\nAs far as I can see, some scholars support the 13 baktun=1piktun theory, while others, as well as yourself, support the 20baktun=1piktun theory. But both camps' arguments have not been addressed in the article! This isn't a hands-down argument about whether the world is round or flat, but a vague scholarly argument about mayan astronomers that died off more than half a millenium ago! Therefore you cannot say (as you are saying) this is right and that is wrong!\nLook, Senor Cuete, I'm asking legit questions that have not been addressed in the article, because this is a topic I'm interested in. More importantly, I don't have a horse in this race, so there's no need to get shirty with me, like I've seen you getting angry and reverting other users' edits...without giving good explanations for your reverts. You seem to be attempting to own this article, as you do not allow others to add anything that you personally do not agree with, and your only \"explanations\" are along the lines of \"this has already been proven\"...yes, by people you agree with! But other scholars are of a different mindset. So, if you believe 20 baktuns = 1 piktun, then say so, say who says that and why; but then also mention the 13 baktun=1piktun theory and the arguments given by those scholars that support that, etc etc etc, like in a normal encyclopedic article. Don't just erase shit you don't agree with. And please answer my questions, because they are ''not'' addressed in the article. I'm not against your theories, I'm getting miffed at the way that you do not allow anyone else to add anything to the article, but you don't even explain why. |\n| 8 | Bigzteve | Because, if there are \"so many 13's\", as you say, then why do the 20's start precisely at the baktun stage...?

I ctrl+f'd to my name to reply to someone and didn't see the warning. Super sorry. Anyway..\nThe MOS explicitly says \"The first word in a compound preposition\" should be capitalized.  Linguistics lesson time.  Into is a compound of the prepositions In and to.  http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/594/02/ Compound_preposition If the space was not removed through reduction the tile would read 'Star Trek In to Darkness'.  If a compound becomes one word, it would represent \"the first word in a compound.\"  The guideline was plain as day, yet casually ignored by those fighting for strict adherence to the lower case guideline.  The most literal, strict, and  pedantic interpretation of MOS (which I don't advocate anyway, for it is just a guideline) demands that Into be capitalized.  There was no written exception for single word compound prepositions.  Into is a specific type of compound, called a copulative similar to words bittersweet and sleepwalk.  FURTHERMORE, into is a very special type of preposition called a directional spatial adpositions.  '''Directional spatial adpositions can only combine with verbs that involve motion.''' Onward and Upward Onto point two.\nI want to take a second to address the \"it cant be a sentence because stars can't take treks\" argument, because I think it is wrong.  When into is used in a sentence, Into modifies the word Trek as trek is the verb.  Remember, directional spatial adpositions can only combine with verbs that involve motion.  'Trek Into' becomes the verb phrase and then 'Trek Into Darkness' becomes the noun phrase because it describes a specific event (such as the Civil War.)  Star becomes an adjective.  Everyone arguing the sentence doesn't make sense is arguing that Star can only be used as a noun.  But in a sentence Star is parsed as an adjective.  We have a Trek Into Darkness.  What type of Trek is it?  A Star type Trek.  It is a Trek (Into Darkness) that pertains to Stars.  (See definition 17 of star in this dictionary http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/star)\nThey have purposely used the phrase in a way which is unfamiliar to fans.  To boldly go indeed (yes I know I split the infinitive, it was an allusion.)  Think of Star and Space as synonyms for Futuristic in this use scenario.  Yet, I would argue that Star has always been the adjective and Trek has always been the noun.  The show has always been about a Trek of the Star/Space variety, and never about Stars themselves taking Treks.  The words have been used this way for a long time.  The new title becomes equivalent to Futuristic Trek Into Darkness, or Trek Into Darkness in Space.  Thus, Star Trek Into Darkness can be read as a sentence fragment because Star describes the type of Trek.  The word Star itself has taken on a less common meaning (in Space.)  Star is in the dictionary as this type of adjective, we just don't see it too often outside of the titles Star Trek and Star Wars.  I personally think they did this on purpose to draw attention to the title, and get people talking about it.  In a way it is reminiscent of the title The Empire Strikes Back. |\n| 2 | Xkcdreader | In short: Into should have been capitalized from the beginning as per MOS and the compound clause.  In addition, the subtitle debate is wildly irrelevant, because as a fragment the title is perfectly parse-able as a legitimate and fully grammatical noun phrase. |\n| 3 | Nsign | Hear, hear.

I've stated similar sentiments elsewhere. Some users need to examine their approach to this encyclopedia and their conduct towards others who act in good faith to make articles as accurate as possible. |\n| 4 | -sche | As a Wiktionary editor, I feel the need to point out that if \"trek\" is regarded as a verb, \"to trek into darkness\" must be a verb phrase, '''not''' a noun phrase. The phrase \"trek into darkness\" can only be a noun phrase if \"trek\" is regarded as a noun; compare \"open the school\" (verb [phrase]) vs \"opening of the school\" (noun [phrase]). (I would have thought Xkcdreader would have realised this when writing that \"'Trek Into Darkness' becomes the noun phrase because it describes a specific event\".) The claim that \"star\" is an adjective is interesting; I would have interpreted it as a noun (used in a noun+noun compound, as is common in English; compare \"field worker\", \"computer science\"), but I see that some dictionaries do consider it an adjective; I've opened an inquiry on Wiktionary into whether or not it meets Wiktionary's Criteria for Inclusion as an adjective. Regardless of whether \"star\" is an adjective or a noun, the second element \"star trek\"/\"star trek into darkness\" is a noun: if \"star\" is a noun, it is singular; it will only be followed by \"trek\" rather than \"treks\" if the whole phrase is viewed as imploring a celestial body \"(O) star, trek into darkness (and be not afraid)\". If \"star\" is an adjective, a verb should only follow it if it is being substantivised, and even then it needs a definite article to avoid sounding like Journalese: \"poor have a hard time finding work\"? A non-substantivised adjective followed by a verb makes no sense: *\"red administer the school\"? In the end, \"star trek into darkness\" does seem to be a noun phrase, like \"descent into hell\", but not for the reasons Xkcdreader claims. |\n| 5 | Xkcdreader | ''Trek Into Darkness'' should be a noun phrase.  It describes a specific instance.  What happens when you put a verb and a noun together?  Darkness is a noun.   If you can put an article in front of it, it should be a noun phrase, right?  You can take ''a trek into darkness'' just like you can take ''a star trek into darkness'' just like you can take ''a trek into darkness in space''.  All the variants appear to be a noun phrase.  It only becomes a verb phrase when you add the infinitive ''to''  to the beginning. My example is [ A Civil War/To Civil War ]  I think the best way I have seen it described is \"Road Trip Into Wilderness\" It describes a specific Trip Into Wilderness. Hey remember that one time when we took a trip into wilderness. The reason I DONT think it is a verb phrase, is because I don't see star as an adverb.  I suppose it could be an adverb, but the dictionary doesn't list it as one.  Let's play a little substitution game.  Muppets in Space (muppets are a noun), Star Trek in Space, Star Trek Into Darkness in Space.  Or when someone says Disney on ice.  Star as an adjective is roughly the same as \"in space.\"  I would also like to point out I think Star has ALWAYS been an adjective, since the starwars/startrek days.  It modify the wars/trek noun to tell you what type of war/trek it is.  A war of the star variety, aka war in space.  The phrase star trek doesnt make sense to me if star is a noun.  If I said Waterfall Marathon, you would think I meant waterfalls running.  I don't think Star's themselves can trek. I think it works like the phrase Safari Adventure, Safari is the type of adventure, so it's an adjective.  Hmm the more I think about it, the more right you seem.  If trek into darkness is a noun phrase, trek must be a specific instance too, and thus a noun.  It works as a command too.  I command you: Trek Into Darkness right now.

If so... well, we basically agree on how the phrase ''functions'' (\"road\" functions like and adjective and modifies \"trip\", indicating the kind of \"trip\"; \"star\" likewise modifies \"trek\"), but I'm making the pedantic point that \"road\" and \"star\" (and \"safari\") are technically w:Noun adjuncts in the noun+noun compounds \"road trip\" and \"star trek\", rather than true adjectives. (:wikt:WT:English adjectives has some good tests of true adjectives. In short, you can tell \"star\" isn't an adjective because you can't say a sky \"is too star\" or \"is more star than\" another sky, nor that one trip is \"roader\" than another trip, whereas you can say a clear Death Valley sky \"is too starry\" or \"is more starry than\" a cloud-obscured London sky, and a trip from Arizona to Death Valley is \"shorter\" than a trip from Arizona to London.

When she settles on something, it's done. |\n| 2 | Ryulong | Well, for one thing, Lucia Black and I are at least on the same page with keeping a singular article and not having one split off for the manga. What I would at least like in all of this is a succinct description of the issues both Lucia Black and ChrisGualtieri have with the page in its current state rather than some massive essay I have no interest in reading when I get home from work.\u2014 |\n| 3 | Lucia Black | I want what you want. For the article to focus on the manga and mention the media thats directly related to it. Idk if this is also what you want, but i want to shorten all other complimentary media of the other series to the point where they dont get their own section (unless directly related to the original manga. Example: PS video game and miscellaneous collections) and instead be mentioned in it's respected series' section because these series already have their own articles that cover that info. '''Example:''' SAC TV series mentions briefly of its manga, OVA, novels, and video games. i just reworked my rendition of what i would like the article to have: . |\n| 4 | SNAAAAKE!! | How about you and Chris agree on ''anything'' between you two (I don't even care anymore), and then we all move on. |\n| 5 | SNAAAAKE!! | I'd also like to show you how I just split Hugo (game show) from the previously massive Hugo (franchise), so youn can compare the content of these 2 articles. |\n| 6 | ChrisGualtieri | What Niemti did with Hugo is essentially what I want to have done with SAC. There was no reason to keep the massive amount of game show related content on a franchise page. You refer to the content on the franchise and split off to cover in detail under WP:SS and WP:DETAIL and to keep in accordance with good writing without running afoul of WP:UNDUE. What I want is simple, clean and effective writing to properly relate different media, point to said media and move on. For that it reins in the and changes a lot of the related pages. Here's the breakdown.\n Ghost in the Shell be the franchise page. Branches off, will not contain ALL the manga information and splits off as per WP:UNDUE.\nGhost in the Shell (manga) be the original manga page and possibly all manga/print media if it absolutely needs to be.\nGhost in the Shell (film), Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence and Ghost in the Shell (video game) will be unchanged, but cleaned up a bit.\nGhost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex will detail the Stand Alone Complex universe which is the largest and most complex.\nGhost in the Shell: Arise details the Arise universe. Film and manga included (as it is now)\nWhat this means is the Ghost in the Shell can finally become a true franchise page and detail its content in a meaningful way. Right now it fails as a franchise page, we do not address or even acknowledge a good amount of information and crush the rest under the original manga material. What about the SAC manga? What about the SAC novels? What about that second SAC manga? What about the prequel novel for Innocence? What about the Animanga? What about the Arise manga? What about the characters? What about the design? Many things are wrong with this page. Lucia Black has ruined all manner of balance to Ghost in the Shell with her incorrect and highly damaging assertion that the manga page be removed in favor of its spot at franchise page: Ghost in the Shell. Now we have the franchise page effectively the entirety of the manga page.\nThe only plot discussed is the original manga plot and in the settings no less.  The plot details is twice the setting and the mangas represent a fraction of the content.\nIn a section titled 'Creation and development' I'd EXPECT the franchise to detail the entirety of the franchise or allude to it in some meaningful way, not discuss only the original manga.\n Publication history is about the original manga, nothing more. Why is it here?\n List of graphic novels. Again, it doesn't even cover the other material, just Shirow's original.\n Reception is ONLY the manga.\n Art books was killed by Lucia the last time round.\n Impact and influence is stripped from the manga and is so undeveloped.\n Multimedia adaptations, this is where you begin to detail the franchise nature, but it is so unbalanced this is just some tacky and poor attempt to make it a franchise page after Lucia has her manga page dominate more then half the page.\n To make matters worse and add insult to injury, perfectly good sourced content is being ripped out and not even attempted to be moved or addressed in a meaningful way.\nSo yes, this may be a long post, but Lucia Black has committed to destroying any meaningful portrayal and balance of the whole. Lucia and Ryulong are both intent on making the manga the focus when it should not be. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KH8KRYstV24toaJD30UYclJcJM1", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518598, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | SNAAAAKE!! | Cold |\n| 2 | Ryulong | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 3 | Lucia Black | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 4 | SNAAAAKE!! | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 5 | SNAAAAKE!! | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 6 | ChrisGualtieri | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3680, "completion_tokens": 100, "total_tokens": 3780}}}

Now we have the franchise page effectively the entirety of the manga page.\nThe only plot discussed is the original manga plot and in the settings no less.  The plot details is twice the setting and the mangas represent a fraction of the content.\nIn a section titled 'Creation and development' I'd EXPECT the franchise to detail the entirety of the franchise or allude to it in some meaningful way, not discuss only the original manga.\n Publication history is about the original manga, nothing more. Why is it here?\n List of graphic novels. Again, it doesn't even cover the other material, just Shirow's original.\n Reception is ONLY the manga.\n Art books was killed by Lucia the last time round.\n Impact and influence is stripped from the manga and is so undeveloped.\n Multimedia adaptations, this is where you begin to detail the franchise nature, but it is so unbalanced this is just some tacky and poor attempt to make it a franchise page after Lucia has her manga page dominate more then half the page.\n To make matters worse and add insult to injury, perfectly good sourced content is being ripped out and not even attempted to be moved or addressed in a meaningful way.\nSo yes, this may be a long post, but Lucia Black has committed to destroying any meaningful portrayal and balance of the whole. Lucia and Ryulong are both intent on making the manga the focus when it should not be. |\n| 7 | Ryulong | It just seems to Lucia and myself that there is absolutely ''no'' reason to separate the manga from this page. This dare I say it \"boner\" for a \"franchise only\" article is blocking whatever headway we can make into reaching a consensus. To note your points:\nBecause this page is about the manga now\nBecause this page is about the manga now\nBecause this page is about the manga now\nBecause this page is about the original manga now\nBecause this page is about the original manga now\nDon't know\nBecause this page is about the manga now\nBecause this page is now about the manga primarily and we do not need to provide extensive coverage to the other aspects here\nIn all of my previous edits to this page I have only removed the extensive prose covering things that are not necessary for any knowledge of the various adaptations. No references have been deleted.\nThere. There is no reason to have two relatively short articles about the same subject just to have a separate page dedicated to one aspect, the original aspect at that, of this item.\u2014 |\n| 8 | ChrisGualtieri | 40 kb is not a relatively short article about the manga. The majority of it prose. What you did to the franchise is horrible and I reject the idea that this page is about the manga now. It is not, this is a key foundation, the cornerstone of the material and the primary entry point for 60000 visitors a month. It should not be the manga with the franchise tacked on.

Considering I might obviously object to it. Now, why should it be included? Well, why not? It's more relevant than an ambivalent name \"drop off point\", those who played the game would know that the Rendezvous point's location was clear from the beginning - the leader of the fireflies told it to the main heroes and that other group of fireflies are gonna be waiting for them there, with the girl Ellen. So yeah, I think it wouldn't hurt to be precise and direct when it comes to this. The plot in this particular article doesn't need to be vague, and free from highlights of key names in the story. It also would help to better understand it, if it had some memorable names of locations, since there were lots of them. If I didn't learn about the story by myself I wouldn't recognize, when shown a clip from the game, approximately what part I'm seeing on a YouTube video about the game's story. So I think it'd be helpful to include the name of an important location for the main heroes (there are like several chapters of their route to US capitol and how they need to get to it) and where quite an important character - Tess, dies. |\n| 2 | Trut-h-urts man | It's the Massachusetts State House, not the Capitol. The game begins in Massachusetts, and the location's name can be seen above the entrance shortly before Tess dies.   \u2022 |\n| 3 | Darkwarriorblake | We're not a cross-reference system for Youtube watching. It being the location Tess dies does not make the location relevant, her death is not tied to the building, if she died on the street, in a subway, on a bus, the major point would still be that she died.  WP: BRD, says you made a bold edit, you were reverted with 3 reasons, and you've opened a discussion, why none of those 3 reasons didn't make sense to you I don't know, but considering you didn't even realize you had the wrong building I question how important you really think it must be. |\n| 4 | Drimidiri | During the ingame play, the main heroes keep calling it \"Capitol\", this is where they were heading. As soon as they are near it, Joel exclaims: \"Home stretch\" in an anticipation to finally reach their rendezvous point. It's relevant, because\n Route to US Capitol is like 1/6th of the game's narration\n That's where main heroes were told to deliver the girl\n That's where Joel learned that fireflies who've been waiting for them are gone (hence followed change of Plan/twist in the plot's direction)\nTess dying there is relevant to the location because she did this solely to buy them some time to escape from the building, otherwise they had a higher chance of being caught by the approaching soldiers. So your subjective reason that it wouldn't matter if it happened in the street doesn't suit up to what writers of the game put behind this particular part of story, so yeah, I wouldn't call the names of the Mass Capitol or the Bridge unimportant to the game story, since they're about destinations that PS3 players have to reach throughout several chapters. |\n| 5 | Trut-h-urts man | If you pause that video you added at 3:58, the sign clearly says (though backwards) \"MASSACHUSETTS STATE HOUSE\". It doesn't matter what they call it. I am in complete agreement with Darkwarriorblake, but I want to make sure you're aware that this is not the US Capitol building.   \u2022 |\n| 6 | Drimidiri | Alright, no need to be so ... Okay, so I mixed up the names a bit, still doesn't justify the deletion, plot should be informative. |\n| 7 | Trut-h-urts man | The plot is already informative. The plot also needs to be clear, concise, and preferably not larger than 700 words (773 at present). It currently says \"The trio fight their way out of the quarantine zone to the drop-off point...\" which is clear and concise already. Adding the location of the drop-off point is unimportant to the overall plot summary.   \u2022 |\n| 8 | Drimidiri | There are several drop off points, why not just name them to avoid possible confusion? Most players associate the place/building with the word \"Capitol\", since it's being called that way in the game. A user, who's not familiar with the story would better \"get\" what this Capitol is about - a rendezvous point. Otherwise he'd have hard time understanding what part of the game featured Capitol if he stumbles upon it in the comments or somewhere else. It's just you're being overly sensitive to the inclusion of the name of the major destination in the beginning of the Last of Us story. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KHLOaIf7aaCVcwTDJp2pQGv0xqt", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518611, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Drimidiri | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Trut-h-urts man | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 3 | Darkwarriorblake | Cold |\n| 4 | Drimidiri | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | Trut-h-urts man | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 6 | Drimidiri | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 7 | Trut-h-urts man | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 8 | Drimidiri | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3692, "completion_tokens": 139, "total_tokens": 3831}}}

Most players associate the place/building with the word \"Capitol\", since it's being called that way in the game. A user, who's not familiar with the story would better \"get\" what this Capitol is about - a rendezvous point. Otherwise he'd have hard time understanding what part of the game featured Capitol if he stumbles upon it in the comments or somewhere else. It's just you're being overly sensitive to the inclusion of the name of the major destination in the beginning of the Last of Us story. |\n| 9 | Trut-h-urts man | Right, \"overly sensitive\". From the guy who went back to change his US Capitol comments in the hope that people who come to comment wouldn't notice that he had the wrong building in the first place. You can't speak for \"most players\" unless you've got a reliable source to back it up - I associated the place with \"drop Ellie off here\", not \"Capitol\", and certainly not \"US Capitol\" as you earlier claimed. Anyone who reads the plot summary here before playing TLoU to familiarize themselves with the story is, in my humble opinion, a complete moron (and has spoiled it for themselves anyway). Anyone who wants excessive detail can use YouTube or the Last of Us Wikia. Sounds like you're being \"overly sensitive\" to discussion, especially when you removed my response above.

She is, of course, the PC in ''Left Behind'', though again I will grant you that is less notable than the main game. However, I think there's more than enough material to justify it. Look it at from outside ''The Last of Us'': Ellie is, from a critic's view, the standout character of 2013, an interesting realistic female character (drawing additional attention due to the fight to put her on the cover and so on), source of a small controversy with Ellen Page, and a successful look at a father/daughter-type dynamic.\nI think that should be more than enough to justify her notability. Now that the BAFTAs and others have rolled past, I can cite 5/6 awards for that first point on its own. Plus, we can talk about her casting, her AI, and design changes in order to further bulk up the article enough to make it distinguishable from the game's one. \u2013 ''''''    23:25, 19 March 2014\n I'm still not convinced. Yes, Ellie is a notable character, and more could be written about her; for example, there doesn't seem to be anything in the article about her being gay, which is a pretty big thing in the games industry, and provoked a lot of commentary.\n But I can't think of a game that isn't part of a bigger franchise with characters deserving of a separate article. Mario, Sonic, Master Chief, Lara Croft, yes - but these are characters that span several games, books, films etc. If there were only one Tomb Raider game, even if it had been a major commercial success, I can't imagine why Lara Croft would deserve a separate Wiki article. Until Ellie appears in several new, independent works (which may well end up happening, who knows?) all of her info belongs in the LAU article and should be understood in the context of LAU.  \n Also - everything you suggest for Ellie's article should be part of the LAU article instead. It's missing stuff, like I said. |\n| 9 | The Millionth One | Just because she's only had one appearance doesn't preclude article status. We had an article on GLaDOS way before ''Portal 2'' came out, and in that case, hell if we'd tried to put the info on GLaDOS in there, there wouldn't be enough space for an article on ''Portal''. The info on Ellie isn't ''that'' big, but it's still fair and more than enough to populate its own. I'm not opposed to expanding this article to contain more, but moving onto such detail on that single character is a bit undue for an article about the game itself (even in this case where Ellie and Joel are both very central to its concept). See also Jenny (''Doctor Who'') and Astrid Peth, both classified as GAs despite each only appearing in one story as opposed to being merged into their respective episodes. \u2013 '''''' |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KHcYXGhytLInnurcsvXwsFGqN3u", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518628, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 8 | The Millionth One | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 9 | The Millionth One | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3270, "completion_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 3317}}}

The Ford Pinto Case.\nThis isn't even remotely complete (especially not from the business ethics standpoint), but it covers a wide range of extremely high-profile reliable sources.  You might argue that those sources are ''wrong''; you might argue that they should read the Schwartz paper, that they ought to be paying more attention to the aspects of the Pinto's history that Schwartz highlights and thinks are important.  Certainly I'm not arguing that we should exclude Schwartz' opinions entirely based on that!  But I think it is clear from going over the sources that his take on the issue does not reflect the mainstream; it is WP:FRINGE among reliable sources that have covered it, and Wikipedia is not the correct place to try and reveal the truth by ignoring that mainstream view or by giving Schwartz' paper weight equal to everyone else who has ever commented on the issue.  As it stands, the majority of the article's take on this aspect of the Pinto's history must reflect the consensus among reliable sources, which generally doesn't take Schwartz' perspective. |\n| 4 | Greglocock | TLDR, here's one description of the scwartz paper, somehow I doubt that Forbes or Popular Mecahics will ever be described as landmark articles-  \"Here are the deaths per million vehicles for 1975 and 1976 for the best-selling compact cars of that era, compiled by Gary T.

She is, of course, the PC in ''Left Behind'', though again I will grant you that is less notable than the main game. However, I think there's more than enough material to justify it. Look it at from outside ''The Last of Us'': Ellie is, from a critic's view, the standout character of 2013, an interesting realistic female character (drawing additional attention due to the fight to put her on the cover and so on), source of a small controversy with Ellen Page, and a successful look at a father/daughter-type dynamic.\nI think that should be more than enough to justify her notability. Now that the BAFTAs and others have rolled past, I can cite 5/6 awards for that first point on its own. Plus, we can talk about her casting, her AI, and design changes in order to further bulk up the article enough to make it distinguishable from the game's one. \u2013 ''''''    23:25, 19 March 2014\n I'm still not convinced. Yes, Ellie is a notable character, and more could be written about her; for example, there doesn't seem to be anything in the article about her being gay, which is a pretty big thing in the games industry, and provoked a lot of commentary.\n But I can't think of a game that isn't part of a bigger franchise with characters deserving of a separate article. Mario, Sonic, Master Chief, Lara Croft, yes - but these are characters that span several games, books, films etc. If there were only one Tomb Raider game, even if it had been a major commercial success, I can't imagine why Lara Croft would deserve a separate Wiki article. Until Ellie appears in several new, independent works (which may well end up happening, who knows?) all of her info belongs in the LAU article and should be understood in the context of LAU.  \n Also - everything you suggest for Ellie's article should be part of the LAU article instead.

Schwartz in his landmark law-review article \u201cThe Myth of the Ford Pinto Case\u201d:\" |\n| 5 | Greglocock | Incidentally the poular mex article says \" Reports range from 27 to 180 deaths as a result of rear-impact-related fuel tank fires in the Pinto, but given the volume of more than 2.2 million vehicles sold, the death rate was not substantially different from that of vehicles by Ford's competitors. \" |\n| 6 | Aquillion | Sure, it says that...  in one sentence at the end, while noting that none of this changes the overarching damage the Pinto did to Ford's reputation.  It also says that \"...arguably the most dangerous fuel tank of all time was the rear-mounted vessel installed on the 1971 through 1976 Ford Pinto. It's possibly the best example of what happens when poor engineering meets corporate negligence\", and most of the article is written along those lines.  My point is that your interpretation (that those overarching death statistics completely vindicate Ford and are a decisive part of the story) is not borne out by most coverage.  Even the Schwartz paper itself doesn't actually support the way you're interpreting it  it does say (in a footnote) that the Pinto's overall safety record is average, but it concedes that Ford was actually liable, notes that the design flaw and danger were real, and describes it in extensive detail.  (\"The key problem, however, with the behind-the-axle location was that it rendered the gas tank more vulnerable in the event of a rear end collision.  The vulnerability of the gas tank was increased by other design features...\"  It goes on to list the same design flaws highlighted by everyone else, acknowledging all of them as real.)  It says that the Pinto performed badly in initial crash tests and continued to perform badly afterwards.  Furthermore, while it says that the Pinto's ''overall'' statistics are typical, \"When the prosecution's expert utilized FARS data to focus on rear-end fire fatalities, the results no longer cast the Pinto in a favorable light.  These data showed that Pintos, while comprising 1.9% of the auto population, were responsible for 4.1% of all such fatalities.\"  Summarizing, it says that \"While this memorandum hardly supported any claim that the Pinto was a major highway hazard, it did suggest that the Pinto's record in this particular class of accidents was worse than the relevant industry average\".  And summing up its conclusion, the Schwartz paper says \"Yet even if the general portrayal of the Pinto as a firetrap should be rejected as false, a limited core of the firetrap myth seems fair enough\".  You are taking one aspect of this one paper out of context and giving it extreme WP:UNDUE weight, then giving the paper itself WP:UNDUE weight because it says (in a footnote!) the one thing you feel is most important to the Pinto's history.  But almost no sources (''not even the Schwartz paper itself'') support your assertion that the Pinto's overall safety record relative to other cars is that important; again, Schwartz mentions it only in a footnote.  The Pinto's overall safety record, after all, is not what most sources are focusing on; they are focusing on the increased danger of fires from rear-end collisions, which is factual and not contested by a single reliable source.  I've said all this above.  Whether this was (for instance) offset by a lower risk of other kinds of risks or whatever is not relevant; the general coverage of the Pinto is that the ''fuel tank in particular'' was flawed in a way that made it unusually dangerous, that Ford was aware of this flaw, and that it did not correct it despite being aware of it.  The Schwartz paper agrees with all of these facts.  It takes a slightly different perspective in attacking some of the myths it says have arisen around the Pinto, but overall, this perspective is WP:FRINGE, and your focus on its footnote about the Pinto's overall safety record is giving WP:UNDUE weight to one aspect of what the paper says even beyond that. |\n| 7 | 129.59.115.3 | At this point almost anything written about the Pinto can be done with hindsight.  The historical accident records presented by Schwartz are very compelling evidence that the overall design performed similarly to other small cars of the time.  But that is just one source.  If it's the only source then I would suggest it be accepted as is since it came from a highly cited, peer reviewed paper.  If a second source shows otherwise then that source should also be included.  I do think it is wrong to claim anything in the Schwartz paper should be considered fringe.  Again, given the paper was peer reviewed and cited by a large number of other peer reviewed papers it is unlikely to contain fringe information.  \u2014\u00a0Preceding unsigned comment added by |\n| 8 | Aquillion | The article cites numerous other sources.  The central issue, though, as I've said repeatedly, is one of weight; it is ultimately only one paper, one whose conclusions disagree with those of most other sources.  Mentioning it in a sentence or two is fine.  Devoting an entire section to it or mentioning it specifically in the lead is clearly giving it WP:UNDUE weight. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KHuGrFt6VsvklEeFCG6TnZp0E0L", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518646, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Greglocock | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 5 | Greglocock | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 6 | Aquillion | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 7 | 129.59.115.3 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 8 | Aquillion | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3801, "completion_tokens": 88, "total_tokens": 3889}}}

Most of them describe it as the concept of not offending. Some are very questionable, for the second is from Helbert Kohl who's described as left-wing by the press and again. |\n| 7 | Aquillion | Again, that's simply not relevant; you can't include or exclude authors based on their politics, only based on their ''reputation''  whether they are a respectable historian or not.  Do you feel that Geoffrey Hughes is similarly unusable?  He says that \"There is little doubt that the formulas \"political correctness\", \"politically correct\", and \"PC\" are now basically pejorative and ironic in their use.\"  Likewise, the history covered by Schultz, Wilson, and so on makes it clear that the term assumed a pejorative meaning after it was picked up by conservatives in the 1980's.  None of the sources you're pointing to ''contradict'' this; none of them talk about any significant non-pejorative usage. |\n| 8 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | It is when they are WP:FRINGE and WP:BIASED and have a reputation for being such. |\n| 9 | Pincrete | ''nb edit conflict.  ''\n'''Comment''' I object very strongly to my name being used and facts mis-represented above. I posted the above suggestion as a 'discussion point' on talk. It was inserted in the lead by Mr Magoo, against my clearly stated wishes, it never 'stood' as he claims. One of the principal objections levelled against my suggestion was that it did not represent the body of the article as that currently stands. We cannot write a lead and then write the article to fit. Even my suggestion does not support the question raised by this RfC, since it puts pejorative second in ORDER only, not what this RfC is promoting namely 'of secondary importance'.\nThe question this RfC should be asking, is, since the 'derogatory/dismissive' use of the term since circa 1980-90 is very well established in all sources, what is the proper WP:weight to be given to that in the lead? I would support a construction that put 'derogatory' or 'pejorative' into the second sentence ''(ie what it is followed by how it is mainly used)''. However, this RfC is asking a fundamentally dishonest question, since it is asking, not only to ignore the body of the article, but to accept an extensive non-derogatory recent, common, use of the term that no sources endorse, ''(except some dictionaries, blogs, anecdotes and WP:OR)''.\nThe article ''(and lead)'', does not ever imply that the term was or is SOLELY pejorative, it charts historical use ''(mainly as a very obscure term among the far left)'', it charts the term's ironical use, before recording the principal modern use, which is to criticise policies, language and actions, which are most commonly seen as the product of an excessively agenda-ed liberal/left orthodoxy with the criticism mainly coming from social or political conservatives ''(ie it is used as a derogatory term)''. |\n| 10 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | We have multiple examples of non-pejorative use in the article. I have gathered even more. And the way you wrote it gives it secondary importance. And I beg you pardon but you didn't word out a wish for it not to be inserted, I thought it was ready to go. |\n| 11 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | You removed Nguyen's paper, noting that it's a term paper (yet it's still cited many times), stating that you talked about this on talk page. But I checked and nowhere did you talk about it? |\n| 12 | Pincrete | We have almost NO modern examples of the term's use in the article, either derogatory or otherwise, and who is evaluating whether the use is +,- or =, because individual editors assessing how ALL the primary sources since 1991 are using the term, would involve an endless, fruitless argument which would make hanging-chads look like a picnic. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KINRLS5BvQjHa26S63dbulO8tIN", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518675, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 7 | Aquillion | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 8 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Cold |\n| 9 | Pincrete | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 10 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 11 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 12 | Pincrete | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3500, "completion_tokens": 126, "total_tokens": 3626}}}

The primary part of NPOV which applies to this article discussion is Achieving neutrality. It has headings like \"Article structure\", \"Due and undue weight\", and so on. That policy says that all significant points of view '''must''' be included. \"Articles must not take sides, but should explain the sides, fairly and without bias. This applies to both what you say and how you say it.\" By failing to identify the weapon the article presents the POV that it was irrelevant, unimportant, trivial, and unworthy of any mention whatsoever. That's a legitimate POV, but it isn't the only one. Another POV, for example, is the one that says this gun had an easier trigger pull, and that the frequency of guns being were drawn increased after the department bought them. In other words, that the gun did matter, and that not all guns are the same. That POV is significant, as shown by the large number of gun publications and even gun articles on Wikipedia. It is my contention that Wikipedia policy not only allows, but actually requires, that we include information of this type, in proportion to its significance. In this case, we're only talking about twenty characters, \", a SIG Sauer P320,\". WP:NPOV is an important policy and it should be followed in deciding this matter. |\n| 2 | Bus stop | WP:NPOV is a policy that is largely inapplicable to what we are discussing. What are the differing points of view that we are supposedly addressing? WP:NPOV is a policy which involves reconciling divergent points of view. Which \"views\" do you think we are discussing? |\n| 3 | 2602:306:C5B4:E3D0:8DC4:BB80:568F:2021 | Please re-read the above statement where I describe two POVs regarding this material. I'm not sure I can say it any more clearly. Also, you haven't mentioned any policy which you consider applicable instead of NPOV. Let's talk policies and sources, not feelings. |\n| 4 | Bus stop | You say \"I'm not sure I can say it any more clearly.\" That is true. You are trying to apply a largely inapplicable policy. The identity of the firearm does not represent a point of view. You say \"By failing to identify the weapon the article presents the POV that it was irrelevant, unimportant, trivial, and unworthy of any mention whatsoever.\" Gibberish. There is virtually no \"viewpoint\" embodied in the presence or absence of the identity of the firearm. It is a detail. An integral part of WP:NPOV is the point of view at stake. Points of view are broader in relation to an overall article than the minor contrivance that you are trying to foist on us. There is no point of view, in the context of this article, that the identity of the firearm is \"trivial, and unworthy of any mention\". Don't misconstrue policy. |\n| 5 | 2602:306:C5B4:E3D0:8DC4:BB80:568F:2021 | \"Foist\"? You think I'm \"foisting\" the NPOV policy on you? No, the NPOV policy applies to all articles. All articles. And POV may be expressed by the structure and contents of an article, not just by the explicit opinions contained in it. I'm surprised that you're not familiar with the policy and its applications. Perhaps that explains why this article was so incomplete when I got here.\nI'll just ask this one more time - do you have any - any - policy justification for deleting this brief, relevant, verifiable, and neutral material? |\n| 6 | Bus stop | \u2014please stop stretching policy to the point at which for all practical purposes it is no longer applicable. You have had the nerve to say this about a good editor here: ''\"Maybe we're better off without 'aggressively incompetent, chronically disruptive editors' like Mandruss. As for my own edits - I think I've added more to the DuBose article in a day or two than Mandruss did over many months, despite his thousands and thousands of words disputes on the talk page.\"'' You apparently think a lot of yourself. But you demonstrate no grasp of the Wikipedia policies that you blithely toss about such as the policy of WP:NPOV. How does the inclusion or omission of the information pertaining to the identification of the firearm relate to the policy of WP:NPOV? Is one \"point of view\" emphasized by inclusion and another \"point of view\" emphasized by omission? What are those \"points of view\"? Elaborate on those points of view please. |\n| 7 | 2602:306:C5B4:E3D0:D1E0:22A:AF88:F346 | OK, I asked you for a policy, you provided none.

Loury summarizes his argument in the following syllogism (p. 437):''\"\nhttp://rss.sagepub.com/content/6/4/428.short 93 times citated.\nPDF\n\n'''They are defining something akin to a game theory.''' Stephen Morris is in fact a game theorist. How else would you describe this kind of social behavior but political correctness? What other term comes to mind?\nTake into notice how similar kind of definition has steeped into regular use:\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/politically%20correct\nhttp://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/political-correctness\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/politically+correct\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/politically-correct\nhttp://www.learnersdictionary.com/definition/politically%20correct\nhttp://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/politically-correct\nhttp://www.thesaurus.com/browse/politically%20correct\nhttp://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/287100.html\nhttps://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/politically_correct\nhttps://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Political_correctness\nThe term is primarily the concept of not offending. The \"pejorative\" use is secondary. The pejorative use does not belong in the lead sentence. This is how  once suggested we write the lead as:\nPolitical correctness (adjectivally, politically correct, commonly abbreviated to PC) is a term used to describe language, actions, or policies which claim to be intended to not offend or disadvantage any particular group of people in society, and to ensure those people are adequately represented and reflected in all walks of life. The term is primarily used as a pejorative by those who see these policies as excessive, or ironically to suggest such excess.\nIt used to stand like that but it was edited out and the primarily pejorative stuck into the first sentence. Here is another source which has opinions for and against. Remember to focus on the neutrality of any source you come across. The aforementioned Glenn Loury states the following:\nTo address the subject of \"political correctness,\" when power and authority within the academic community is being contested by parties on either side of that issue, is to invite scrutiny of one's arguments by would-be \"friends\" and \"enemies.\" Combatants from the left and the right will try to assess whether a writer is \"for them\" or \"against them.\" |\n| 3 | Aquillion | '''Primarily pejorative'''.  Most of these sources you've provided are to dictionaries, which aren't really useful for analyzing the detailed cultural implications of a word; none of the other sources you provided support the idea that there's significant non-pejorative usage.  My reading is that Loury is unequivocally using it as a pejorative (his title is 'Self-Censorship in Public Discourse'); likewise, Morris is discussing the reasons why he thinks people behave that way in a manner that is clearly using the term as a pejorative.  Neither of them goes into any depth on its history as a term, just on their feelings about the phenomenon they feel it describes.  Meanwhile, article has, at the moment, ''nine'' sources that go into depth on how its primary usage in modern culture is as a slur, pejorative, political attack, or similar terms; and nothing in the article really provides any significant non-pejorative history or usage, which means we have to reflect that primarily pejorative usage in the lead. |\n| 4 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Would you mind pointing out these supposed \"nine.\" |\n| 5 | Aquillion | They're the first nine sources in the article!  Maybe one or two of them are for other parts of that sentence, but my reading is that almost all of them support the interpretation that the term is primarily pejorative in its current usage.  Anyway, the purpose of an WP:RFC isn't for us to repeat the same arguments we've had over and over again, it's to get a general sense of where everyone stands and to attract outside opinions so we can try and determine consensus. |\n| 6 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Have you actually bothered reading them? Most of them describe it as the concept of not offending. Some are very questionable, for the second is from Helbert Kohl who's described as left-wing by the press and again. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KIH5Z3VdgxZfZppRmpRoLFinuKp", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518669, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 2 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Aquillion | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 4 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 5 | Aquillion | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3659, "completion_tokens": 119, "total_tokens": 3778}}}

After looking at Wikipedia:Canvassing#Inappropriate notification, I don't consider this contact by ''Magoo'' to have been WP:Canvassing (''Pincrete'' may disagree).\nThe edit summary of the edit removing the section says, \"These are simply examples of use based on primary sources + there is opposition to this section expressed on talk.\" The article talk page section referred to there seems to be the one headed #Civitas think tank pamphlet. I don't think that discussion established a consensus for removal, and I see that the article contains a cite of this BBC article headed, \"PC thinking 'is harming society'\", and subheaded, \"Britain's institutions are infected with political correctness which is damaging society, according to a book published by a right-wing think-tank.\" That article discusses the viewpoint presented in the book and also discusses an opposing viewpoint put forth by Inayat Bunglawala, of the Muslim Council of Britain. This seems to me as if it goes a long ways towards meeting the requirements of WP:DUE. See also this article in The Guardian.\nRegarding topical significance of the removed material, I think that it tried to throw a light on something deserving of mention\u2014described by ''Magoo'' in the discussion as \"the view of how political correctness has become to be used as a shield by those commonly viewed as discriminated against.\" In the discussion, ''Pincrete'' said, \"I strongly object to its inclusion in its present form.\" I don't like the removed content as it was presented either, though probably not for the same reasons. I would suggest a rewwrite to widen the scope, perhaps including material growing out of this townhall.com article headed, \"Neighbor Didn't Report Suspicious Activity of San Bernardino Killers For Fear of Being Called Racist\" and including material saying, \"This is the same politically correct culture that lead to the Ft.

Besides, you are here now so that issue is academic. |\n| 3 | Wtmitchell | As I said above, I would suggest a rewrite of the removed section rather than a simple unrevert to restore the section in the form it had prior to its removal. The rewrite need not necessarily feature the Civitas think tank source to which you objected as a primary source. Instead, it might assert that it has been posited that a culture of \"political correctness\" is responsible for  damaging society by protecting some groups from having their stated views or, in some cases, their actions challenged (I don't state that well; I'm not much of a wordsmith). I described and linked four secondary sources above (, two which had been cited in the removed section and two others which I dug up) which seem to me to support such an assertion. It seems to me that such a subsection would fit well as a subsection into the ''Modern usage'' section as the current ''As a conspiracy theory'' and ''False accusations'' subsections. My purpose here was not to champion the inclusion of such a subsection, however. It just seemed to me after the removal of the section had been called to my attention that the removal had been premature, and I chimed in to say so and to invite more discussion about that.    (earlier ''Boracay Bill'') |\n| 4 | Dimadick | While \"political correctness\" is not among my major concerns, Pincrete's reasoning about the sources seems rather surprising to me. You are purposely excluding newspapers? But this article is not about the use of the term in purely academic sources.\nPer Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources about news sources: \"News sources often contain both factual content and opinion content. \"News reporting\" from well-established news outlets is generally considered to be reliable for statements of fact (though even the most reputable reporting sometimes contains errors). News reporting from less-established outlets is generally considered less reliable for statements of fact. Most newspapers also reprint items from news agencies such as BBC News, Reuters, Interfax, Agence France-Presse or the Associated Press, which are responsible for accuracy. The agency should be cited in addition to the newspaper that reprinted it.\" \"Editorial commentary, analysis and opinion pieces, whether written by the editors of the publication (editorials) or outside authors (op-eds) are reliable primary sources for statements attributed to that editor or author, but are rarely reliable for statements of fact.\"\n\"For information about academic topics, scholarly sources and high-quality non-scholarly sources are generally better than news reports. Many news organizations rely heavily on press releases from the organizations or journals involved. News reports may be acceptable depending on the context.\"\nWhich would suggest that the relevance of any given source primarily depends on the context of its use in the article. Not necessarily on being scholarly or not. |\n| 5 | Pincrete | , quick reply, nowhere, I believe, do I say we are excluding newspapers, indeed we do use them. What I said ''(or meant)'', is that we largely exclude instances of papers, books, sites, TV etc. USING the term ''(as opposed to writing about the term/concept)''. Partly because it would be OR to extrapolate significance and also because there are far too many thousands of instances of use, that such use would need special significance in  order to be justified. An article on any political term would need to take a similar approach, we would not extrapolate the meaning of 'conservative' for example from the millions of times the word has been used to describe this or that person or action. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KIZflRYi1L2bpVx0rmt0yhGJCsv", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518687, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | Pincrete | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Wtmitchell | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 4 | Dimadick | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 5 | Pincrete | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3737, "completion_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 3811}}}

It has not been \"proven Mr. Izumi was not the age he claimed\". What happened is that in 1987 a report  appeared as follows: \"A Japanese expert on aging says reports that the oldest Japanese man died earlier last year at the age of 120 are false  he was only 105. The true age of Shigechiyo Izumi, who died in February 1986, was discovered through research in his family's registration records, says Toshihisa Matsuzaki, director of the Department of Epidemiology at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology.\" That's not proof  that's just someone with a different opinion who does not, apparently, give details on the research that led to that opinion. Nothing's been \"proven\".\nWP's article on Izumi  correctly reports this as a controversy.  \"He was one of only two people verified to have lived past their 120th birthday, although subsequent research has discounted the verification. [etc etc] research into Izumi's family registration records indicated Izumi might have been 105 when he died.\" (Note the word ''might''.) GRG agrees  that the question is an open  not settled  one.\nSo your statement that \"the Japanese health ministry still lists a case such as Izumi as verified, even though it has been proven Mr. Izumi was not the age he claimed to be\"  casting doubt on the Ministry's reliability  is nonsense. As far as the evidence goes, the Ministry might be perfectly correct.\nI'll repeat what I said elsewhere months ago. There are indeed topic areas in which a particular source (or class of sources) is acknowledged as authoritative and overriding of other sources, for example in an area of historical research in which all the facts are in, the dust has settled, and careful scholarly analysis has refuted or corrected earlier low-quality treatments. A dynamic database of living (or recently deceased) people, with new evidence coming in all the time from a variety of sources, is the polar opposite of such a situation, and it's impossible in this case to fix on any one source as superior to the others, because no source can possibly be in possession of all the facts about all oldsters everywhere.\n'''''' |\n| 2 | Fiskje88 | Okay, touch\u00e9... I should have noted the word ''might''. Still, your last remark is what intrigues me: \"A dynamic database of living (or recently deceased) people, with new evidence coming in all the time from a variety of sources, is the polar opposite of such a situation, and it's impossible in this case to fix on any one source as superior to the others, because no source can possibly be in possession of all the facts about all oldsters everywhere.\" I understand your adversity towards relying on the scientific verification process (which is NOT solely done by the GRG), but wouldn't it be safer to err on the cautious side if academics have researched that out of all 110+ claims more than two/thirds are fraud?  I wouldn't, as an encyclopedia, want to be reporting false information to the general public... |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KIltmkBmpjOpcOs6XVB6kpDG1XF", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518699, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | EEng | Assured-Dominant |\n| 2 | Fiskje88 | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3291, "completion_tokens": 45, "total_tokens": 3336}}}

What I said ''(or meant)'', is that we largely exclude instances of papers, books, sites, TV etc. USING the term ''(as opposed to writing about the term/concept)''. Partly because it would be OR to extrapolate significance and also because there are far too many thousands of instances of use, that such use would need special significance in  order to be justified. An article on any political term would need to take a similar approach, we would not extrapolate the meaning of 'conservative' for example from the millions of times the word has been used to describe this or that person or action. |\n| 6 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | If we are to exclude simple mentions then we would be double encouraged to remove the entire Baa Baa sheep bit which doesn't even mention the term (which you have argued for and opposed removal of). But he's right, you have a history of purposely excluding any sort of a source which you personally disagree with and including bad ones you agree with. |\n| 7 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Civitas was added in 2012, removed this August by your tag team buddy. Compare the state of the article from May 20 2015 to September 23 2015. The two made over a hundred edits to the article in the meantime and never edited or undid each other's edits. I believe there were possibly two times where the other's grammar was fixed? |\n| 8 | Pincrete | , I see the season of goodwill has not affected your gift for making absurd claims about the other editors on this article ''(in the hope of influencing newcomers to the page?)''. this is what the closing admin had to say at your last attempt to blacken the name of 3 long-term editors on this page'' 'This is a baseless report brought by an editor who failed to obtain the results they wanted at ANI and then came here. The filer's spin on the evidence they've compiled is remarkably long but devoid of quality. Closing.' '' |\n| 9 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | I retorted in this way only because you outright and knowingly lied above about Civitas not having been part of the stable version for 2-3 years. And like I wrote above, he hadn't even bothered to read the filing. He thought the ANI was started by me, even though two people had written the opposite. And even then they mostly deal with SP investigations and not MP. I didn't see a single other MP investigation there. |\n| 10 | Pincrete | , I really don't give a shit about your pathetic defence of repeatedly made but wholly discredited accusations. Learning to apologise might be more constructive than trying to defend the indefensible. However, you compound matters by repeatedly accusing me/anyone/everyone of lying. My post said: ''to the best of my knowledge neither the 'Civitas' material nor the Dawkins quote have ever been part of a stable version (not in the last 9-ish months at least)''. Where is the untruth in my statement? Where the lie? If it is significantly inaccurate, I will happily apologise to the editor it was addressed to. Learn to read please.\nYour SPI was rejected because there was zero evidence and there was zero evidence because there was zero 'crime'. I've no idea what the admin meant about the ANI, but do recall that you ended that ANI by promising to STOP making accusations. I have never communicated with any other editor of this page, and I have never knowingly lied ''(I can make mistakes, like anyone)''. Your repeated accusations achieve nothing, except advertise your taste for WP:Trolling. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KIfLHtfBJCHPAHlnLxs2h70eILN", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518693, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Pincrete | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 6 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 7 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 8 | Pincrete | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 9 | Mr. Magoo and McBarker | Cold |\n| 10 | Pincrete | Cold |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3405, "completion_tokens": 104, "total_tokens": 3509}}}

I am not sure whether you have ever heard of the SSA, but in effect it is led by the American government; as such, the researchers in the study could base their results on information provided by the American government \u2013 an organisation that, I would think, probably has more private and confidential information about its own people than most scientific researchers as well as amateur genealogists would ever have access to. I am therefore quite confident that the presented percentage of verifiable supercentenarians at ages 110-111 is fairly representative of what can really be verified (a word I am not sure you understand the true meaning of).\nSecond, the SSA study was based on an entire census, covering all inhabitants of the United States of America. Thus, it will not be necessary to also research school records, local newspapers, hospital records, or whatever was implied\u2026 as all American citizens were covered in the study! Once again, having to contact people was not necessary as the researchers had access to governmental information, enabling them to have a myriad of source material to work with; moreover, their access to governmental information explains why it would not have been necessary to only focus on a \u201csmall sample\u201d.\nThird, I do not understand why you are referring to the researchers as \u201cYoung and his helpers\u201d; this clearly shows you have no idea who participated in the research, as some of the co-authors included Dr. Perls \u2013 Director of the New England Supercentenarian Study , a recognised authority within the field of age validation \u2013 as well as Dr. Desjardins \u2013 a doctor in demography at the university of Montreal . Implying that they are merely \u201cYoung\u2019s helpers\u201d is therefore, in my view, a libellous comment to make and detrimental to your own credibility in this discussion as you have just proven you have no idea what and who you are talking about.\nLastly, as your focal point in this discussion seems to be discrediting the GRG and/or this Mr. Robert Young, I have taken the liberty to go to the GRG website and look at its list of publications (go to , click on \u2018Publications\u2019 and scroll down). To my surprise, I discovered that this paper you are using as a source was in fact not Mr. Young\u2019s first or second paper \u2013 my interpretation of a \u2018rookie\u2019. As such, you juxtaposing his name next to the word \u2018rookie\u2019 implies once again that you, quite unequivocally so, haven\u2019t got an inkling of what you are saying and/or suggesting as you are not even willing to research your own assumptions, leading to once again making a libellous comment about someone who has proven his expertise in the field.\nConcluding, if your goal was to discredit the concept of age validation and/or assert the idea that the GRG is not a scientific organisation, then I really have to disappoint you as you have only been able to accentuate as well as perpetuate the obviousness of your own incompetence in this discussion. |\n| 9 | Chimney148 | The GRG has been validating supercentenarians for nearly two decades, and tracks supercentenarians to well over 100 years ago, Also currently the GRG does not have the capacity to immediately verify every supercentenarian.

I should have noted the word ''might''. Still, your last remark is what intrigues me: \"A dynamic database of living (or recently deceased) people, with new evidence coming in all the time from a variety of sources, is the polar opposite of such a situation, and it's impossible in this case to fix on any one source as superior to the others, because no source can possibly be in possession of all the facts about all oldsters everywhere.\" I understand your adversity towards relying on the scientific verification process (which is NOT solely done by the GRG), but wouldn't it be safer to err on the cautious side if academics have researched that out of all 110+ claims more than two/thirds are fraud?  I wouldn't, as an encyclopedia, want to be reporting false information to the general public... |\n| 3 | EEng | I'm sorry, but once again you're pointing to something (the paper \"Typologies of Extreme Longevity Myths\", primarily authored by the notorious Ryoung122) which proves something quite different than what you think it does. The paper's abstract asserts that \"Invalid age claim rates [are] 65% at age 110-111\", with the clear implication (which you have adopted) that ''invalid'' should be interpreted as ''false''. But that's not backed up by the details given in the paper's text, which says something else entirely:\n''In the comparison of supercentenarian cases generated by the Social Security Death Index to a validated list generated by the GRG, one observes that the rate of validation [is] 35% at age 110-111''.\nThe 35% comes from this table , wherein we see that the US Social Security Death Index lists 610 \"Total claims\" (i.e. persons listed as 110-111) of whom the \"Number validated\" (the number for which Mr. Young was able to find acceptable documentation) was 219. And 219/610 = 35% \"validated\", leaving 65% \"not validated\". The problem is, not validated isn't the same as ''false''.\nA thorough attempt to validate an age claim would have to include searches of local school, church, and public records, local newspapers (for birth announcements etc.), hospital records, and any number of other potential sources, as well as contacting surviving family. (We often hear that a validation was blocked by the inability to contact family and gain their cooperation.) Clearly Young and his helpers could not possibly have brought such exhaustive efforts to bear on every one of these 610 individuals. (And that's just for the 110-111 age range; the table lists almost 3000 people ages 109-120!)\nIn other words, the 65% of cases not validated simply means, well, that they ''weren't'' validated i.e. for whatever reason, appropriate documentation wasn't found. In some cases this will be because the case is in fact false, but in others it's because the documentation is out there somehwere, but wasn't found by Young with the time and resources he had. ''And there's no way to tell how many cases are one or the other.'' The interpretation that \"two thirds of claims are false\" is complete nonsense.\nThe reason for this mess is that Young made the most rookie of all rookie blunders, which is to attempt to use the entire population of cases as his sample. This never works, because spreading your time and resources over the entire population inevitably gives you far lower data quality than would be obtained by concentrating on gathering high-quality data for a smaller sample. The right way to estimate the true proportion of valid cases would be to take a sample (e.g. N=100) and ''really beat the bushes'' to do a completely thorough job on that smaller number, instead of a sloppy, partial job on the population of 3000. This would yield an estimate of the proportion of true claims which is something like +/- 5 percentage points off the true proportion. To be frank I'm shocked by the low quality of the statistical thinking on display in this paper, especially since some, at least, of the authors are well-known researchers. I can only guess that changes were made (especially to the abstract) late in the publication cycle without full review.\n'''''' |\n| 4 | Legacypac | EEng you just demolished the whole \"validated\" argument as well as the \"GRG is so scientific\" story.

If lists two minor charges, both dismissed.\nThe birthdate shown on that record is 3/12/1972, not 9/12/1972 as in your edit.\nThe previous status quo as to history was the result of discussion at a time when there were multiple experienced editors active on the article. There wasn't anything really \"formal\" in that area, and I can't recall what the sources were, but there was at least some discussion about the area of his history, it was decided to omit some of the sourced information on relevance grounds, and others were at least aware of it and didn't object to the result. To my mind, that approximates a consensus that I think should be respected until replaced by a new one.\nI feel we need a fairly high relevance bar for this kind of history, and I don't see much relevance at all to the shooting. Do you? \u2015 |\n| 2 | IIvIIozzie | Re: \nI'm not sure why you are having such a difficult time using the search feature. Click on Court Records > Search by name  >3. Criminal & Traffic Name Search.

(Sorry not confirmed yet so had to post image on another site)\nThis was my mistake. You are correct and that should be edited accordingly. *Edit: Updated accordingly.\nHis criminal history should be included within the page as it otherwise appears to be bias as to what facts belong on the page. His history as a criminal probably had more influence on his life and into his decision making on the day of the shooting rather than being a rapper, a music producer, entrepreneur, and motorcycle enthusiast.\nAs explained above. As the information resides in a background category within the page it does not pertain to the event of the shooting, just the history of the individuals involved. |\n| 3 | Mandruss | Got it using dubose (not debose), sam.\nThank you.\nThis doesn't appear to be a response to my point. You are basically saying that consensus doesn't matter if you disagree with it.\nStill disagree, but see 3.\nI'll revert to ''status quo ante'' and hopefully we'll get more participation. I can live with the change if there is even a small consensus for it. \u2015 |\n| 4 | IIvIIozzie | Yes, you should receive the results I listed with Dubose, not desbose.\nYou're welcome\n You suggest that a consensus took place without citing such. The majority of people discussing a consensus in the talk page and removing edits in the main page due to the consensus verdict is either you or IP edits (anonymous)\n The act of removing background history from Samuel DuBose that can be viewed as negative whilst retaining irrelevant history that can be seen as positive is suspicious at best and biased at worst. Your history of revisions on this article seems to indicate the latter. Please explain how Mr. Dubose's history as a rapper, a music producer, entrepreneur, and motorcycle enthusiast has any relevancy on the case.\nSeeing as you have the majority of edits on this page over the last several month's I'd expect a consensus to be unlikely.\nI would like to further state that having 84 Criminal & Traffic court cases is extremely irregular and should not necessarily be perceived as negative or positive. Where one individual can claim he lived a life as a career criminal another can claim he was being targeted. I would also like to note that many of Mr.Dubose's court cases involved him driving, which has an obvious connection to the case.\nThe page also suggests to the reader the shooting may have occurred as a black hate crime with inclusions such as \"Two other black men had been killed by UCPD officers, both with Tasers: a student in 2011 and a mental patient in 2010\". These type's of edits are irresponsible and goes against the neutrality of wikipedia.\nWith all the above in consideration I will be reinstating my previous edit. |\n| 5 | Mandruss | I hoped and believed we could resolve this in an orderly manner.

After reviewing your wiki contributions I couldn't help but notice your involvement in pages involving shootings, most predominately, those revolving around Black Lives Matter. There is edit's on Walter Scott, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, and of course, this one. Heck, if there is any police involvement in a black person's death you've probably added your two cents to their wiki page. While all of which is commendable (go you!), what isn't so great is you have a habit of edit warring. While some of it is innocent enough, there is a lot of undoing revisions and reverting going on with things you don't like. When another contributor disagrees with the reverting, your go-to is seeking a consensus, while removing the contributor's content from the wiki page. With your involvement in all of these pages it's not difficult to see you are editing with an agenda. Let's keep Wikipedia neutral. Instead of seeking assistance from , perhaps a nice tall glass of wikibreak is in order to wash all that bias down. Cheers! |\n| 7 | Mandruss | Your gracious invitation to a pissing match is declined, especially since you are an editor with some experience very possibly trying to conceal their past behind a new username. You can criticize my history all you like, but at least mine is visible.MSGJ is not a \"like-minded individual\". They are a fair-minded admin who issued me the one block of my career and has suggested that I seek outside help against disruptive editors when no one else is around. I suggest more focus on working together with mutual respect, less on ferreting out personal-history weapons to use against your opponent(s) in a content dispute. This is a good example. \u2015 |\n| 8 | IIvIIozzie | My intentions are not to have a pissing match, as you put it, merely to keep articles on Wikipedia honest. And no, I'm not some secret archrival from wiki pages past, this is my first edit to Wikipedia and from it I can tell this is going to be a long road. I have worked on different Wiki's though, if that's what you're looking for. Your like-minded colleagues contribution's can speak for themselves and if they or anybody else you choose(inclined to agree with you) show up I'd be happy to engage with them at that time. Unfortunately, working together is not a possibility. I will further neutralize this article and your presence would only inhibit me from doing so, as your history shows. Your record of editing to construct a subtle narrative on these pages quite simply, is not allowed.I am going to assume in good faith that all of this partial activity was not intentional but an unexpected outcome of your passion for the black lives matter movement. I am asking you politely to please refrain from future black lives matter page edits until you can do so impartially. |\n| 9 | Mandruss | What a load of articulate crap. I have very little personal interest in BLM, as clearly evidenced by the fact that you could count my edits to that article on the fingers of one hand, and probably still have a finger or two to spare (and even those edits were quite inconsequential and uncontroversial). If you were truly interested in reality, you would note that I work on many things other than those that happen to fall under the BLM umbrella. You would also note that my edits in this article, and others like it, are about as likely to favor one side as the other. If you want references from other experienced editors who have worked with me on articles of this type, I would be happy to provide them (but of course you would then simply dump them into the same uncontrolled-bias category as you've placed me, as the only alternative would be to admit that you might be wrong, which is out of the question).Your paranoia is on clear display and is all too typical of the traditional Wikipedia battleground mind-set. I will continue to maintain focus on Wikipedia process, and, if your delusion that you are the only righteous editor in the vicinity causes you to edit war, we know how to deal with that. I will ask  to keep an eye on this situation and to provide guidance as we move forward, or to suggest a different approach. \u2015 |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KJ97nzB47XGPxYiTGnh2j5rN0Sp", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518723, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Mandruss | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | IIvIIozzie | Cold |\n| 7 | Mandruss | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 8 | IIvIIozzie | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 9 | Mandruss | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3607, "completion_tokens": 89, "total_tokens": 3696}}}

Still other economists think the BW system worked fine for decades, and it was Keynesian fiscal policy in Washington DC that caused Bretton Woods to collapse.\nWhy is the Berkley / Brad Delong viewpoint the only view included?

Do not revert my edit yet again  first check your own bias.  According to your talk page, you apparently studied theology and claim to have a PhD in said.  Does that make you the world expert on every single religion (hopefully that is a rhetorical question)?  The subject I am questioning is either economics (which is NOT really Brad Delong's specialty) or else I am questioning political science (which is what every major university, including your Yale and Delong's Berkley) considered economics until the 1970s (give or take, the switch didn't happen all at once).   Just because you are (supposedly) a PhD in theology does not mean you mastered all religions, and certainly doesn't mean you know economics.  There are many many economic schools of thought, even if theology majors are unaware.  Brad Delong's well established left wing politics (see the wikipedia page on him) makes him more of a political commentator than an economist (his job title might be economist, but his activities are political). |\n| 3 | DEddy | I'm curious... what White/Bretton Woods policies does DeLong say have been proved wrong?

Has anyone presented evidence\u2014not the same thing as allegations\u2014how whatever White did at Bretton Woods actually BENEFITED the Russians?  After all Russia did not join Bretton Woods/World Bank. |\n| 4 | Other49states | As I understand Delong's various comments (the link didn't work for me, but Delong has made many comments on the subject so I am inferring the bad link had similar sentiments)...  As I understand Delong's comments, he wasn't really talking about White as a Soviet spy / informant / etc.  Delong is an ardent supporter of Keynesian economic policies  or by some definitions, \"new Keynesian policies\".  Keynesian policies practiced in the UK led to England needing an IMF bailout in the 1970s.  In the US, Nixon declared \"we are all Keynesians now\" as Vietnam war spending spiraled higher  Watergate and a decade of stagflation followed.  Keynesian policy \"works\" in theory, but using real world results in Keynes' home country and in the US it failed miserably...  so Keynesian proponents, like Delong, started promoting \"new keynesianism\" (under various labels) trying to defend perpetual deficit spending.  In fairness to Keynes (the man, not the political movement Delong represents), Keynes advocated fiscal/monetary policy that \"leaned against the wind\"  deficits during recessions, but SURPLUSES when the economy was growing (pay the debt back).  In practice, politicians calling themselves Keynesian (like Mr Delong) have used Keynes theories to justify perpetual deficit spending.  No, they don't say they support perpetual deficit spending, but if you look at the real world results: they run deficit spending all the time... which is quite different from what Keynes himself proposed  (one might argue that implementing Keynesian policy in real life would require omniscience that no human actually possesses  but if the so-called Keynesians were attempting to act as Keynes advised, they would show some actual spending surpluses at least during some periods).\n Anyway, I suggested the propaganda be removed precisely because it has very little, if anything, to do with Harry Dexter White or Bretton Woods.   It was Brad Delong's opinion, falsely represented as though it were anything more than one person's opinion.  Some economists agree with him, many do not  but Keynes \"lost\" every argument for reasons that have nothing to do with Keynes or White (perhaps this should be on the page instead?).  It is true that White and Keynes disagreed on many points, and also true that the US government ended up prevailing on each of those points  because of the US economic and military position at the end of WW2 (when the Bretton Woods agreement was reached).  The US delegation happened to be headed by Harry White. England needed money and resources to rebuild its economy, and the US was the only major economy not in rubble after the war.  The US government (Truman, Congress, etc, etc) decided how they wanted things done,  and for diplomatic reasons tried to be sensitive to other allies wishes (including England).  But the US government said \"jump\" and everyone jumped.  Harry Dexter White (whatever his Soviet spy status may have been) was the messenger of Washington DC.   Much of the IMF, World Bank and the Marshall loan program were designed to help western economies rebuild (under US influence) and prevail against the Soviet influence  which is why the Soviets didn't join.  Harry White might have leaked that agenda explicitly to the Soviets (intentionally or unintentionally), but the agenda of US lending wasn't exactly hard to discern.  Harry White probably leaked (intentionally or unintentionally) more sensitive information to the Soviets  but that is outside my area of knowledge, and I have to defer to others commenting / writing in other parts of the talk page. |\n| 5 | Rjensen | Skidelsky and de Long are two of the world's most famous economic historians, and Wiki rules on NPOV require the INCLUSION of major views.  Are there economic historians with a different view on Bretton Woods? If so please ADD them so readers can get a full picture of the debate. Other49states seems to defend a Soviet spy and eliminate White's critics based on zero Reliable sources. Actually Other49states is primarily concerned with attacking a very different set of Keynesian ideas re deficit spending during a recession, but that is not connected to Bretton Woods. |\n| 6 | Other49states | What are you talking about ?  I said, explicitly, that I don't know enough about your stupid spy crap, and I deferred to others.  Brad Delong is hardly a world famous economist, he is a widely known US professor closely associated with democratic administrations, and critical of republican administrations.  Want to hear the names of economists that are world famous?

Rather, it's one of three aspects of the scene called nu metal revival. The three aspects are 1. bands that previously left the nu metal style returning to the style. Such bands include Staind, Slipknot, and Linkin Park. 2. Metalcore and Deathcore bands such as Of Mice and Men, Emmure, and Suicide Silent adding nu metal to their sound and 3. New new bands forming, such as Issues, From Ashes to New, Islander, and Hackivist. While many of these new bands incorporate new sounds, otherwise take on a traditional nu metal sound, and the only fusion that is consistent enough across multiple bands to constitute a new, distinct genre is nu metalcore.

You claim there is such sources, but you've failed to provide any. I have seen sources that list the nu metal revival and nu metalcore together with a hyphen due to their significant overlap, but none that actually claim they are synonymous, and several write it that way BECAUSE they aren't synonymous. For example from this source: https://thatsrockingawsome.wordpress.com/2016/09/01/7-nu-metalcorenu-metal-revival-bands/ opens with this sentence: \"With the current Nu Metal revival, bringing us new Nu Metal and Industrial Metal bands, along with the currently emerging Nu Metalcore genre, here are 7 Nu Metalcore/Nu Metal revival bands.\" The fact they used the word \"along\" means they consider the nu metal revival and nu metalcore to be two separate things, it's just a matter of reading comprehension rather than blindly inserting sources that include words together. The SINGLE source that was being used for that argument doesn't even exist anymore, but you were too lazy to check that out because it's so much easier for you just to revert edits than actually try to improve the quality of the page. Part of the advantage of wikipedia is that anyone can edit it and then the more technically minded people can clean it up, and you're just breaking the system.\n\"there are no sources to claim what you are saying.\" My main point is that they aren't the same thing, not the specific explanation for how the nu metal revival works. You don't need sources to prove that two terms aren't the same as it's the null-hypothesis, just like how you don't need a source to not list metalcore as a random bands genre, you need a source to back it up. Requiring a specific source to claim that nu metalcore and nu metal revival aren't synonymous is inane as it's a claim based on the synthesis of several sources talking about the nu metal revival, many of the older ones made no reference to metalcore whatsoever. You can also just look at the bands people group in nu metal revival to see it refers to multiple different types of bands, most of which can be put in one of the three categories I gave, but sources aren't needed as my argument is not a claim made in the article or am trying to add. But you want a source? Here is one from the article on nu-metal: http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/02/25/nu-metal-revival-apocalypse/ They refer to the same three aspects I referred to, they even outline it in three different stages both chronologically and sequentially in the organization of the article. It's not that I lack sources for my claims, it's that it's a PAIN to change references. Anyway, regardless of sources, calling bands which are obviously not metalcore (like From Ashes to New) nu metalcore is just plain idiotic. If you insist on this page being about the nu metal revival, it should be moved to a different title. You're abusing wiki logic at the expense of common sense by using local-quality sources with no central coherence, this is not how sources were intended to be used.\n\"it is never claimed that the bands returning to nu metal are apart of the revival\" Yes, it is, it is implicitly by them being in the section in the first place and it making up the majority of the section. There is also PLENTY of sources which list them as part of the revival, including the one I posted last. This is the most asinine argument I've ever heard.\nThe main issue I see is how terms change over time. When the old articles talked about nu metal revival, they were talking about the recent financial success of old nu metal bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit, and various bands that returned to the old style or reformed in response. People didn't start applying it to metalcore bands until they started making connections with what the older nu metal bands where doing as initially they were just considered to be metalcore which so happened to take influence from nu metal. It wasn't until much later that nu metalcore was recognized as a distinct genre from both metalcore and nu metal. People didn't initially use the term nu metal revival just because it takes time for specific terms to catch on, but you can see here that it's still used to refer to the original comeback: http://www.rockfeed.net/2016/09/14/limp-bizkit-korn-tour/ As a result in changing trends over time, there is a bias to see nu metalcore and nu metal revival to be listed together, especially in top search results, but that doesn't mean people are actually treating them as being the same thing, just closely related things. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KJXFriDSZsu0FD6HpUyMoC5eCdf", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518747, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | Issan Sumisu | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Ganondox | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3762, "completion_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 3809}}}

Furthermore, in the \"minor revival\" section of the nu metal page, it is never claimed that the bands returning to nu metal are apart of the revival, nor does it say anything about which bands are continuing the traditional style or creating a new style, as sources do not reflect that information. We'd need a lot more sources (of which we do not have) to provide the information you are requesting. |\n| 3 | Ganondox | \"The problem is that there are sources to claim that \"nu metalcore\" and the \"nu metal revival\" are the same thing\" No, there is not. You claim there is such sources, but you've failed to provide any. I have seen sources that list the nu metal revival and nu metalcore together with a hyphen due to their significant overlap, but none that actually claim they are synonymous, and several write it that way BECAUSE they aren't synonymous. For example from this source: https://thatsrockingawsome.wordpress.com/2016/09/01/7-nu-metalcorenu-metal-revival-bands/ opens with this sentence: \"With the current Nu Metal revival, bringing us new Nu Metal and Industrial Metal bands, along with the currently emerging Nu Metalcore genre, here are 7 Nu Metalcore/Nu Metal revival bands.\" The fact they used the word \"along\" means they consider the nu metal revival and nu metalcore to be two separate things, it's just a matter of reading comprehension rather than blindly inserting sources that include words together. The SINGLE source that was being used for that argument doesn't even exist anymore, but you were too lazy to check that out because it's so much easier for you just to revert edits than actually try to improve the quality of the page. Part of the advantage of wikipedia is that anyone can edit it and then the more technically minded people can clean it up, and you're just breaking the system.\n\"there are no sources to claim what you are saying.\" My main point is that they aren't the same thing, not the specific explanation for how the nu metal revival works. You don't need sources to prove that two terms aren't the same as it's the null-hypothesis, just like how you don't need a source to not list metalcore as a random bands genre, you need a source to back it up. Requiring a specific source to claim that nu metalcore and nu metal revival aren't synonymous is inane as it's a claim based on the synthesis of several sources talking about the nu metal revival, many of the older ones made no reference to metalcore whatsoever. You can also just look at the bands people group in nu metal revival to see it refers to multiple different types of bands, most of which can be put in one of the three categories I gave, but sources aren't needed as my argument is not a claim made in the article or am trying to add. But you want a source? Here is one from the article on nu-metal: http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/02/25/nu-metal-revival-apocalypse/ They refer to the same three aspects I referred to, they even outline it in three different stages both chronologically and sequentially in the organization of the article. It's not that I lack sources for my claims, it's that it's a PAIN to change references. Anyway, regardless of sources, calling bands which are obviously not metalcore (like From Ashes to New) nu metalcore is just plain idiotic. If you insist on this page being about the nu metal revival, it should be moved to a different title. You're abusing wiki logic at the expense of common sense by using local-quality sources with no central coherence, this is not how sources were intended to be used.\n\"it is never claimed that the bands returning to nu |\n| 4 | Ganondox | EDIT: Looked at the archived source you referred to, it's a joke. First off, it never even claimed that nu metal revival and nu metalcore. Rather, they proposed nu metalcore and new nu metal (a term no one else uses except in a literal sense) as possible names for a subset of the nu metal revival with certain qualities, but they actually divided that group of new bands into two categories, those that metalcore based and those that are nu metal based (also, they list old bands as being part of the rival, contrary to your claims, just not as part of nu metalcore or new nu metal for obvious reasons). Second, their use of the terms was prescriptivist, while Wikipedia is a descriptivist resource. Unless we are referring to a specific guy's work, which we aren't, multiple people need to actually use the term for it to be a legitimate alternative. Finally, it's an extremely low quality source, it clearly went down for a reason, and it should never have been added to Wikipedia in the first place as it does not reach quality standards. It's just a random person's blog who no one else referred to, someone just put it on Wikipedia as a quickly dirty way to add a new genre as frankly the way new edits is enforced is very poor, people pay more attention to whether a link exists or not than what the link actually is too. I guess you could use multiple blog sources to prove it is a way people use a term, but it would take MULTIPLE sources, not just one, and again, the article was making grossly inaccurate claims about how people refer to nu metalcore bands and then using it to make grossly inaccurate claims about what bands constitute nu metalcore. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KJdviKIjr9xBnXXBmw1ZqKFRNIt", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518753, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | Issan Sumisu | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Ganondox | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 4 | Ganondox | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3809, "completion_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 3871}}}

This only shows that this region had some political meaning in some parts of history. For example, Dukedom of Salan have no political continuity with present day Vojvodina, but this fact showing that this region was important in that time. To say that territory of Vojvodina was part of some countries (Turkey, Hungary or Roman Empire) is more history of these countries then history of Vojvodina. Only autochthon political creations, which had political centre in territory of present day Vojvodina are really important for its history. If you, for example, wrote about history of Bulgaria, you will not wrote that Bulgaria was part of Turkey or Byzantium Empire, but you will wrote about time periods when Bulgaria was independent or autonomous. There is clearly no political continuity between medieval and modern Bulgaria, but medieval Bulgaria is part of history of modern Bulgaria. In the same way, Roman Pannonia, Dukedom of Salan and \"Empire\" of Jovan Nenad are parts of history of modern Vojvodina and we should to include this here.\n\"I do not deny that there is a Serb political history in the region, but presenting it while omiting or twisting the political history of other nations is not acceptable\"\nWell, I accepted your view that Hungarians come to Vojvodina in IX century (no matter that this statement is disputed, because anybody could draw that map with red dots, and I read some sources, which claim that Hungarians didn\u2019t settled in Vojvodina before XIII century). Can we do this: I will write about political history of Serbs and you write about political history of Hungarians, and we will put both things in text. I want to put only these things: Dukedom of Salan, including map (It is more Bulgarian history then Serb or Hungarian), King Dragutin, Serbian despots and Jovan Nenad (map about Empire of Jovan Nenad is partially biased and I will not insist to put this map there). However, I think I could to change this map in Photoshop, so, I could write in map: Territory ruled by Jovan Nenad instead of Serbian Empire. Would this be acceptable by you? I will also write more about him in text, to say that he was vassal of Hungarian king latter.\nAlso, to satisfy you, I want to upload map of Hungarian counties in Vojvodina territory after 1867. What you think? I also think that we both agree to put modern map of Vojvodina there.\nAs for war in 1848/1849, let find some neutral view about this.\nNow, what would you write about history of Hungarians?\n\"I am glad though that you agree with the large majority of my amendments, as for the few that you don't agree with, this is only because you fail to see that Vojvodina's history is (at least) as much Hungarian as Serbian\"\nBut you wrote these things in non-neutral way. Change the way in which you saying that, and I will not object.\n\"you disqualify yourself from this discussion\"\nI only defend official history instead of the alternative one. But I will accept all your reasonable arguments against official version of history.\n\"OK, here's the idea. I'll strip the article to those parts that are not disputed. I'll leave out or only mention in very general and neutral terms those events of which the relevance, accuracy or both are disputed, like the 1848-1849 revolutionary years. I suggest no one should include disputed subjects, before we discuss them here and reach some form of consensus\"\nI agree.\n\"I have requested for comment on [[1] ] to get more input and a better quality of consensus\"\nLet try first to find consensus between us, and if this doesn\u2019t work, then ask for help (I am really get tired of this revert war between us).\nPANONIAN |\n| 2 | Najroda | I think that the current version is as complete as possible, without the disputed parts.

Your own? You have very pecualiar idea about neutrality\"\nI can say same thing for you, because your \"neutral\" page is totally pro-Hungarian (You put word \"Hungary\" in many places, where it was not necessary to mention it).\n\"You changed the region became and integral part of Hungary into The region was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, which ruled over it until the 16th century. Which suggests that Vojvodina was already a political entity between the 9th and 16th century, occupied by Hungary (\"rule over\"), which is simply not true\"\nIt is true that Hungary ruled over it, because, original inhabitants of this region were Slavs, Bulgarians and Vlachs, who fought against Hungarian occupation. Hungary enslaved them and ruled over their land. So, it was not integral part of Hungary, but it was more a colony.\n\"You deleted the background of the Serb immigration from the 14th century onward. Why?\"\nIt was not true.\n\"You deleted the reference to the separation of the military frontiers from Hungary. I'm starting to wonder if you consider any reference to Hungary not neutral? If you're serious about that, we should delete all references to Serbia too. Shall I?\"\nIt was not separated from Hungary. You objected that original article was pro-Serb. Well, you make it to be pro-Hungarian. If this going to be neutral, it will not be pro-Hungarian.\n\"You changed Vojvodina and the Banat were reintegrated into Hungary into these territories were incorporated into Hungary, as if they had not been part of Hungary for centuries...\"\nIt is more political then historical statement. Vojvodina only was occupied by Hungary, not part of it.\n\"I wonder why you deleted the ethnic break-down of Vojvodina in 1920\"\nBecause it creates a false impression that Vojvodina existed with present day borders in 1920, which is not true. It was ethnic breakdown of non-existing territory. I will also delete ethnic map from 1910 because of same reason, and because this map is inaccurate.\n\"If I were as childish as you I guess I should be shouting \"stop vandalism and anti- Hungarian propaganda\".\"\nI agree with you to make this article really neutral (not pro-Serb), but I didn\u2019t agree to make it pro-Hungarian.

You do not expect from me to accept all, do you? Did you hear for the word compromise?\nPANONIAN |\n| 7 | Najroda | I hate to bring you the news, but your \"contributions\" do this article little good. For example the line \"Serbs started to settling in this region in large number from the 14th century onward.\" contains no less than 3 grammatical errors...\n\"You put word \"Hungary\" in many places, where it was not necessary to mention it.\" Not necessary or unwanted from a Serb point of view?\n\"It is true that Hungary ruled over it, because, original inhabitants of this region were Slavs, Bulgarians and Vlachs\". So what? That happened all the time. This argument has zero relevance, especially if you consider that we are discussing the era of the great migrations. Besides, if you look at it now, Slavs were also relative newcomers, which makes your argument even more ridiculous.\n\"who fought against Hungarian occupation\". You just say this, but don't know it. Or come up with some sources. The border of proof is on you and I ask you not to revert this section.\n\"Hungary enslaved them and ruled over their land. So, it was not integral part of Hungary, but it was more a colony.\" Same here. Don't just make wild claims, but back them up. BTW if the Slavs had such a terrible time in Hungary, how come the Slavic Serbs came to Hungary in such large numbers? Again, burden of proof, don't revert unless backed by facts.\n\"It was not true.\" Again, easy to say. The migration of the a large Serb population is very relevant to the history of Vojvodina. I gave one, and you simply deny, without even giving an alternative view. That makes the article incomplete. This is what RADOS LJUSIC says in \"The History of Serbian Culture\" (featured on the website of the Serb unity Congress): ''\"The Turkish conquest of the Balkans and Danube basin were preceded and followed by migrations of the Serbian people. As the Turks penetrated into the land the Serbs withdrew. The Serbs migrated ahead of the invading Turks because they did not want to live under the Turkish rule, and they sought protection in the neighbouring Christian states who welcomed them to settle along the deserted borderlands... and the Serbs participated in their wars.\"''\n\"It was not separated from Hungary.\" It was a part of Hungary before the Turkish occupation. Even you don't deny this. Yet, after the Turkish conquest when Hungary was admninistrativelyb restored (even if ruled by Vienna), certain parts, like the military frontier, Banat, Transylvania were not ruled from Budapest but directly from Vienna. How do you call this if not seperated?\n\"It (reintegrated into Hungary) is more political then historical statement. Vojvodina only was occupied by Hungary, not part of it.\" Yet you say \"After World War II Vojvodina was restored as a province of Serbia\". but of course that's a neutral remark, right? Sorry pal, but you're measuring with double standards!\n\"Because it creates a false impression that Vojvodina existed with present day borders in 1920, which is not true. It was ethnic breakdown of non-existing territory.\" You speak about Vojvodina, even in a medieval context, but of course only when it suits you... But of course the fact that only 1/3 of the population at the time was Serb is anti-Serb propaganda, right?\"\n\"You do not expect from me to accept all, do you?\" I expect you to accept them if they are backed by facts, and reliable sources. So far yo keep reverting, but haven't named one reliable source yet... |\n| 8 | Zocky | I won't go into discussions about content here, as I don't presume to know enough about the history of Vojvodina. But, I would like to ask both Najroda and PANONIAN to take a deep breath and count to 10. Then, please read . Then, please consider stopping the tit-for-tat point-by-point exchange. Try to establish what facts you both agree on, and then try to provide a balanced representation of sources for things that you don't agree on. That should make a decent article. |\n| 9 | PANONIAN | Zocky,\nI deleted now all disputed parts, and I expect that Najroda not put anything in this article, if there is no consensus about that.\nAnd I read your link: \"One country's days of glory can be another country's age of foreign occupation\".\nI agree with this statement. For Serbs, Hungarian rule was only foreign occupation. So, Najroda want to present his occupant point of view and that insulting my national pride. I am especially insulted by his presentation of World War II. He wants to rehabilitate fascists, and that insulting me personally, because some members of my family were victims of Hungarian fascists in World War II (And he defend this occupation).\nPANONIAN |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KK1CptF7TH7N70P2tEkHHNgQSHL", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518777, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | 213.240.4.23 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 7 | Najroda | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 8 | Zocky | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 9 | PANONIAN | Unassured-Submissive |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3694, "completion_tokens": 79, "total_tokens": 3773}}}

For Serbs, Hungarian rule was only foreign occupation. So, Najroda want to present his occupant point of view and that insulting my national pride. I am especially insulted by his presentation of World War II. He wants to rehabilitate fascists, and that insulting me personally, because some members of my family were victims of Hungarian fascists in World War II (And he defend this occupation).\nPANONIAN |\n| 10 | Najroda | Panonian, you're an idiot. You have crossed a line now. I never rehabilitated fascists (quote where you think I did that!). My father was a forced labourer in Nazi Germany and he nearly died there of pleurisy. Nevertheless I don't equate Germans with Nazis. In your simplistic mind though Hungarians equal Fascists and occupiers.\nHave you ever considered that Hungarians may consider Serbs (at least ones like you) as occupiers? Doesn't it bother you that Serbs were granted asylum in Hungary when they were fleeing from the Turks? And now they're behaving as if God gave it them exclusively? Doesn't it bother you that prior to WW II Vojvodina never had a Serb majority, and that it now has only because of ethnical cleansing?\nOf course it does.

I also think putting the hindu portal link is alittle half-stepping. RamaChandran's solution is cool, but i still think the page should be free-and-clear of all religious infoboxes, period. any thoughts on this? |\n| 2 | IAF | In my opinion, the Hinduism infobox must be there. I am not being communal, but Hinduism is the largest representative of these 3 religions. Sikhs, Jains, accept Hindu Gods and Goddesses, and the social-fabric of India regards these 3 as sub-sects of Hindus only. Unlike the orthogonal Abrahamic Faiths, there is congeniality, and unision amongst the Dharmic faiths.\nOn a more practical level, ''the Indian law does not distinguish between the Dharmic faiths and regards them under the Hindu fold''. Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists are not minorities in India (if at all then only as a populous minority and NOT as beneficiaries of reservations et al).\nSomebody added the cult called Ayyavazhi, whose addition I highly disapprove of, but there is consensus over it and so I can't do much. |\n| 3 | Pirus~enwiki | The problem here is that we need to take a wiki kind of world point of view - while we can present the obvious \"indian\" point of view, it is also important to note that dharmic religion has spread beyond the gates of india, and that some have slowly grown into an identity of thier own. Putting the hindu infobox here may seem alittle biased, because there are many people of dharmic faith who may not identify with hinduism (i even hate using that word considering the vastness of it all, but its an umbrella within itself!). We simply cannot say that Buddhist Sri Lankans or Punjabi Sikhs can be branded under hinduism. While it is obviously true that Dharmic religons have an incredible amount of cohesion between its followers (like between hindus and buddhists in nepal), that isnt a proper reason to include the hindu infobox (or ANY infobox, for that matter) in this article. |\n| 4 | IAF | Pirus, actually 99% of all Sikhs and Jains ar in India, and they don't deliberately assert themselves as \"We are separate\". Only separatist Khalistani Sikhs in UK and filthy rich Patels in UK/US actually do. Hindus are found anyday in langars, Sikhs are found daily in temples, Jains organize Garba dances and celebrate Gujju festivals with gutso. There is so much intermarriage between Sikhs, Hindus and Jains without giving a second thought to religion.\nAll this separatism between Hinduism and the Dharmic faiths is a campaign started by the English media in India. The likes of those pseudo-secular Hindu-bashers have wantonly stroked the embers of separatism. When Narendra Modi a few months back proposed a law that would not require registration for Buddhists, and Jains converting within any Dharmic faith, the English media created a stink. Jain and Buddhist youth were subjected to \"surveys\" whether they consider themselves Hindu or not. The very raising of the question of identity of their religion triggered doubts of an identity crisis, and many replied in the negative. In normal circumstances, religion does not cross their mind. Of course a majority were coaxed by their hardliner leaders also. Dalit Buddhists also replied in the negative obviously (thank you Dr. Ambedkar!).\nAlthough Modi needs to be shot on sight, on this particular issue I don't think he was wrong. Constitutionally also, this would be perfectly allowed.\nAnyway coming back to the point, since there is no Sanatana Dharma infobox, a Hinduism infobox would be appropriate in this article. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KKChZIBmE72xwXjRldkljbqM78n", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518788, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Pirus~enwiki | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | IAF | Assured-Dominant |\n| 3 | Pirus~enwiki | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 4 | IAF | Assured-Dominant |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3442, "completion_tokens": 74, "total_tokens": 3516}}}

In fact, your stretching of their position strains credulity, since it's completely bullshit. |\n\n| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Jack1234567891011121314151617 | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 2 | Lukacris | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Jack1234567891011121314151617 | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 4 | Beyond My Ken | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 5 | Jack1234567891011121314151617 | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 6 | Beyond My Ken | Cold |\n---\n| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | IAF | Pirus, actually 99% of all Sikhs and Jains ar in India, and they don't deliberately assert themselves as \"We are separate\". Only separatist Khalistani Sikhs in UK and filthy rich Patels in UK/US actually do. Hindus are found anyday in langars, Sikhs are found daily in temples, Jains organize Garba dances and celebrate Gujju festivals with gutso. There is so much intermarriage between Sikhs, Hindus and Jains without giving a second thought to religion.\nAll this separatism between Hinduism and the Dharmic faiths is a campaign started by the English media in India. The likes of those pseudo-secular Hindu-bashers have wantonly stroked the embers of separatism. When Narendra Modi a few months back proposed a law that would not require registration for Buddhists, and Jains converting within any Dharmic faith, the English media created a stink. Jain and Buddhist youth were subjected to \"surveys\" whether they consider themselves Hindu or not. The very raising of the question of identity of their religion triggered doubts of an identity crisis, and many replied in the negative. In normal circumstances, religion does not cross their mind. Of course a majority were coaxed by their hardliner leaders also. Dalit Buddhists also replied in the negative obviously (thank you Dr. Ambedkar!).\nAlthough Modi needs to be shot on sight, on this particular issue I don't think he was wrong. Constitutionally also, this would be perfectly allowed.\nAnyway coming back to the point, since there is no Sanatana Dharma infobox, a Hinduism infobox would be appropriate in this article. |\n| 5 | Pirus~enwiki | First of all, you should go ahead and check the indian government's cencus figures. They do assert the fact that sikhs and buddhists are different. And anyone who has spent more than an  hour studying/comparing Buddhist/Vaishnu Hindu Dharmas can see that they are more than separate enough to be considered separate religons, however similiar they are. Personally, my local hare khrisna temple and tibetian buddhist retreat have shown me two totally different perspectives on dharmic religion. No \"english media\" of any sort influenced me here. If you want to label them both as simply \"hindu\", go ahead. Dont spread that kind of bull**** around here.\nSecond of all, i take very personal offense to your whole thing about \"separatist Khalistani Sikhs in UK and filthy rich Patels in UK/US actually do\" . In all my life, of the HUNDREDS OF PATELS i have met, i have NEVER, EVER, EVER met one that questioned their hindu faith. Ones i know arent exactly poor either. You are totally ignorant of gujaratis in diaspora; keep your mouth shut before you comment on them.\nRegarding the jains - since many of them are guju, of course theyre gonna take part in guju festivals, this is no brainer.\nAlso regarding the intermarriage - ask any real hindu family (or from my personal perspective, gujarati family) about marrage to a sikh family, and theyll have your *** on a platter. This is nonsense. Getting alittle too friendly with your comments here.\nAnd regarding Mr. Modi? While i have no personal qualm against him (<.< >.> AAHOA here), its pretty obvious why his Hindutva style shoudlent be presented here. Dont use him as an example, anyone whos read anything about him knows his current status. |\n| 6 | Pirus~enwiki | There are millions of Buddhists that are not living in India which need to be accounted for in this article. Saying this, we should not take an indian point of view here. |\n| 7 | IAF |  |\n| 8 | IAF | Talkig of marriage, a Hindu Patel won't get married to a Tamil Iyer Brahmin either and neither will a Maharashtrian Goud Saraswat Brahmin get married to a Rajasthani Marawari despite all being Hindus. The example that you gave has nothing to do with religion, but casteism.\nYet the cultures, customs and religious practices amongst the Dharmic faiths are more cohesive than repellant and so I think that the Hindu infobox would be appropriate. |\n| 9 | Pirus~enwiki | For your \"pea brain\", from my previous post\n There are millions of Buddhists that are not living in India which need to be accounted for in this article. Saying this, we should not take an indian point of view here. \nnext time actually read what i write\nthis article is not supposed to be taking an indian stance, its supposed to be taking a world stance. plain and simple, get out of your \"indian air force\" shell and start thinking about people who follow dharmic religions outside of india\nand youre an idiot for your assumtion regarding patels and jains. that statement alone speaks for itself. and yes, i happen to be a patel. not that it matters here on world view wikipedia.\nand please stop pointing out the similarities between the buddhists and hindu bases. these are well known, but they do little to track both belief systems under one umbrella. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-86KKI8nhOUGSrD0BYHAg9dZyTUyxr", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1696518794, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | IAF | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 5 | Pirus~enwiki | Cold |\n| 6 | Pirus~enwiki | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 7 | IAF | Aloof-Introverted |\n| 8 | IAF | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 9 | Pirus~enwiki | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3738, "completion_tokens": 104, "total_tokens": 3842}}}
