Aside from the issue of me not being British (articles on British subject use British grammar) we should have no major problems with the prose. Now, I think we're close to making this article featured, but we need to take care of these things first:\nAll references need to be properly formatted. This is arguably the main issue, judging by the last FA nomination.\nI'd really like to see some of the books listed cited in the article, or, if the editors on this page have read them, at least explain why they are not used to cite the article. If no one has read the books, I can borrow a copy of ''Exit Music'' from my university library.\nSome of the details about the albums since ''OK Computer'' can probably be moved to their individual album pages, or if applicable, to the \"Musical style\" section.\nAs for the \"Musical style\" section, I think it would be fine the way it is for a book, but for an encyclopedia article it should be more ordered. Maybe start by discussing band member roles, then influences and changes and style, then influence on other groups, or some simliar outline.\nAre there any other notable aspects of Radiohead such as music videos, tours, themes, and references in pop culture that can be discussed in-depth? If so, we can create new sections. See Pixies and The Smashing Pumpkins for examples.\nThat's what I think should be done. Any thoughts? |\n| 2 | 172.130.215.123 |  |\n| 3 | WesleyDodds | Fair use images can be included if they are discussed in the text. That's why the images in The Smashing Pumpkins are there (I should know; I'm the one who brought it up to FA standard and submitted it to FAC and had to deal with all the image discussions. Sorry you don't like it ) Obviously you don't want to included a lot of fair use media, but if a copyrighted Radiohead image is worth commenting on in the text, then it falls under fair use. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5qWmLFac9sNJb1Vj3kSsVHJhMTE", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930012, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3057, "completion_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 3121}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | WesleyDodds | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | 172.130.215.123 | Aloof-Introverted |\n| 3 | WesleyDodds | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

The group in question has appeared on the following: Millerites, Adventist, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Template:Adventism, Nontrinitarianism, and List of Christian denominations. I and others removed it per undue weight. After removing it from \"List of Christian denominations\", I then noticed that that article has no clear boundaries for inclusion (it is a vast article of course), so I commented on the talk page, asking for other input. It was replaced there and remains, and no one has disputed that. However regarding the other articles, I believe this group is not notable enough by Wikipedia standards to be mentioned there, as such would be undue weight. |\n| 5 | Zahakiel | '''Comment''' - Perhaps it would be useful to the discussion, and my own understanding here, if you could explain what you mean ''exactly'' by \"undue weight.\"  You are clearly not quoting from the actual policy WP:DUE, which deals with letting every matter in an article be given a neutral point of view.  Let me quote it specifically for others who may wish to comment: \"NPOV says that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by a reliable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each.\"  There is no question of ''neutrality'' in including a non-Trinitarian group in a list of non-Trinitarian groups, however small and \"unimportant\" you personally believe it to be.  The \"in proportion to each\" phrase, which you might be hanging your hat on, does not apply to mere mention in a list, since the articles themselves already have standards for what information can be included, and issues of \"prominence\" are to be settled therein.  There is clearly not a WP:SPAM issue going on, since verifible information is being provided in an appropriate place, and there is no advertising taking place - the article is already there.  I am not trying to be unduly combative here, but I do believe you are misapplying the policy due to your personal view that \"this group is not notable enough by Wikipedia standards to be mentioned here.\"  I have to demand at this point, WHAT \"standards\" are you talking about?  As I pointed out in the RfC request, the group is notable enough for a Wikipedia ''article'', but you say it is not notable enough for inclusion in a list?  That is a clear double-standard, and needs some ''policy-based'' justification rather than just the whims of an individual editor. |\n| 6 | AnonEMouse |  |\n| 7 | AnonEMouse | I  with a technical issue about the RFC notice not showing up on Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Religion and philosophy. I restored the notice, hopefully it will show up the next time the bot runs. Now as to the issue of the group's inclusion on this page: I think the issue is one of Notability, rather than strict size of group, and our definition of minimal Notability is demonstrated by whether or not we have decided to have an article on the group itself. If we can show (1) the group is notable, and (2) its status as a Nontrinitarian group is notable, it should be included in the list. Now it seems that for point (1) the CSDA is debatably notable, but so far the community has decided that it is, as it's article has survived two AFDs. For point (2), the question is really one of manageability, and I'll have to defer to Christianity subject experts. If there are hundreds of groups that we have articles on that would be considered Nontrinitarian, then it would be unmanageable; we won't be able to list them all without having the article be taken up by the list, and we'll have to only list the ''most'' notable ones. Currently it seems like we have 30 groups listed, which is large, but not unmanageable, and there are three red links, which implies that the highest levels of notability are not required. This is all per the guideline Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Lists of people.

I have contributed content to that article, though I did not begin it myself.  I have supported it being kept in an AfD by ; and since the article was retained, this editor has gone out of his way to attempt to remove its mention from every other article that lists it, even when the criteria has been fully met.  The improper use of the article-content-policy undue weight is being used as an attempted justification for not mentioning it in even the most inclusive of lists, like the List_of_Christian_denominations; and although a third-party has informed this user that even \"tiny\" groups are suitable for inclusion as long as their existence can be verified, (Talk:List_of_Christian_denominations#Scope_of_list) and although notability must be (and is) demonstrated within the article itself, or it would have been deleted, the attempts elsewhere - such as here-  have continued unabated.  This user has also sought to introduce prejudicial and entirely incorrect information into the article itself, and while this is a topic for another RfC, I believe it shows strong evidence of bias.  While the same has been said of me (see the \"spam\" comment by Mr. MacLaurin above - which is about introducing advertising data ''into'' articles, not about including them with sets of other like groups) I have not violated any policies in the attempt to get neutral, verifiable material included in the entry, and to remove incorrect information from badly misused sources (see the talk page for several examples of this by the editor in question; e.g., completely false data about the size of the movement). I will agree to whatsoever consensus neutral, third-party editors create, but I do not believe that a valid Wikipedia article about a Christian group should not be in a \"List of Christian denominations,\" or that a valid article about a non-Trinitarian group should not be included in what is obviously a very inclusive list of non-Trinitarian groups. |\n| 2 | GabrielVelasquez | Thanks. Although I appreciate what you are doing here and the legalese, Ps and Qs, could you please edit this so it doesn't just allude to this christian denomination/group, but I know from my first read there. Thanks. |\n| 3 | Zahakiel | Hi Gabriel; I am not sure I perfectly understand your meaning, but certainly the issues I am raising apply to all small groups.  The objection of the editor who is mentioned in my request for comment believes that the particular group mentioned (i.e., the CSDA Church) does not belong in this list of non-Trinitarian groups; perhaps he believes this of all small movements, (although I contend a large degree of subjectivity would be involved in making such a determination) but his primary interest is in Adventist-related articles, and this is why my request is phrased as it is.  Perhaps you can recommend some alternate wording for a more general request during or after this request is processed?  Thanks. |\n| 4 | Colin MacLaurin | Comment (I was mentioned above). The group in question has appeared on the following: Millerites, Adventist, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Template:Adventism, Nontrinitarianism, and List of Christian denominations. I and others removed it per undue weight. After removing it from \"List of Christian denominations\", I then noticed that that article has no clear boundaries for inclusion (it is a vast article of course), so I commented on the talk page, asking for other input. It was replaced there and remains, and no one has disputed that. However regarding the other articles, I believe this group is not notable enough by Wikipedia standards to be mentioned there, as such would be undue weight. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5qWUUqLfFM7pu4zSKeZxdasjgTh", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930012, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3448, "completion_tokens": 75, "total_tokens": 3523}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Zahakiel | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | GabrielVelasquez | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 3 | Zahakiel | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 4 | Colin MacLaurin | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

That's why the images in The Smashing Pumpkins are there (I should know; I'm the one who brought it up to FA standard and submitted it to FAC and had to deal with all the image discussions. Sorry you don't like it ) Obviously you don't want to included a lot of fair use media, but if a copyrighted Radiohead image is worth commenting on in the text, then it falls under fair use. |\n| 4 | WesleyDodds | The problem is what do you discuss about them, do you put in your interpretation of a video or song and then try to find reviewers or academic analysts that agreed with you in their review or thesis on Radiohead? That kind of thing doesn't seem appropriate for this at all. You are aware how many Radiohead fans there are on the internet who would just love to add their own ideas on every lyric or video to the article if we had such sections, right? As soon as someone starts a section on Lyrics, the article is doomed for at least a year. ;)\nAs for South Park, yes they did appear on it as a main part of the plot (didn't do their own voices though, apparently). It's worth noting, but not any more so than the fact that Radiohead got sampled by x song, toured with x bands, opened for x bands, or that their songs appeared in x films, or that their albums- specifically OK Computer- very frequently appear on critics' lists. All these were deleted when the small trivia section was removed. If you can find a way to incorporate them back into the text, fine. They are on the trivia page now along with a bit of other information that has more direct bearing on the subject of the article than South Park. \nIf anything, the information found in the old (quite concise and relevant) trivia section that has now been spun-off to a new article (where it will no doubt quickly acquire irrelevant data), should be added back to this article wherever it best fits.\nI don't think there is a set format for music articles, and personally I found big problems with the Pumpkins article despite its featured status- it had way too many (unapproved) images and clutter, and unnecessary sections verging on original research. Sadly due to the Radiohead article's more responsible adherence to copyrights, the main thing missing from this article besides what was removed to trivia, is any graphical representation of the band, i.e. the album covers or Donwood's artwork, because this is how they choose to represent themselves. I don't really understand why a case can't be made to allow a single image of an album cover or any other artwork, in the section describing band Collaborators, when other articles flagrantly violate the rule and get featured, but whatever.\nFair use images can be included if they are discussed in the text. That's why the images in The Smashing Pumpkins are there (I should know; I'm the one who brought it up to FA standard and submitted it to FAC and had to deal with all the image discussions. Sorry you don't like it ) Obviously you don't want to included a lot of fair use media, but if a copyrighted Radiohead image is worth commenting on in the text, then it falls under fair use. \nThat's naive, I've seen these debates before. It doesn't matter how much the image is referenced in the text, it will still be removed by the anti-image people trying to protect Wikipedia from lawsuits that will never happen. We had the album covers visible in the disography section toward the bottom of the page, with a caption explaining their context as artwork done by Donwood and Yorke- removed! We had a tiny image of the Kid A bear logo Donwood designed, placed next to the text that explains Donwood's graphics work with the band- removed!\nYou and the people editing Smashing Pumpkins have a more tolerant philosophy, which is nice- although in that article's case when I looked at it last, it looked fanboyish with the number of redundant images of stylish band members you had there which didn't seem to relate to the text. Anyway, good job for getting it passed. Have a chat with ErleGrey about his views on the subject. \nThis article is a reasonably detailed history section with a few minor add-ons, and that works. Nearly anything that's actually NPOV and relevant to this main article can fit in a discussion of the history. For example that's why the influences were added to the OK Computer section. Otherwise how do you describe the difference in sound between say The Bends and OK Computer. Influences are not just in the article to namedrop, but because it's impossible otherwise to write about the sound of music in an NPOV way, especially when the band refuses to fall permanently into any genre. Just my thoughts. \nYes, discuss the musical traits when necessary in the biography. However, much can be achieved with a separate section that analyzes a band's musical style and influence. Such sections are now almost expected of music articles (and they very well should be, since we're dealing with the subject of music). \nI think you are missing the point. We don't want any section that \"analyzes\" their style, right? That would be POV. We have to document the subject and the way it has been seen, not analyze it ourselves. There's no objective way to analyze musical traits in pop music- unlike classical music it's not written so we can't analyze it mathematically, even if it seems to fall into certain patterns of time signature/structure/etc, the sound and affect is not limited to that.

That's certainly worth noting. |\n| 6 | WesleyDodds | These books with \"More complex analysis and interpretation\" would be ''great'' sources for the article. Plus books have ISBN numbers, which allow you to track down different editions of books easier. Unfortunately, links to fan archives of articles isn't necessarily sound copyright. I imagine the magazines and/or writers still own the rights to those articles. Plus, unless they are direct scans of the articles, their veracity is not the most reliable. Those citations must not link to sites violating copyright; list the sources as you would the original magazine article. That's just how it works.

Does that sound like a claim of divinity to anyone else? |\n| 2 | Momento | It is from the mahatma. |\n| 3 | PatW | No need for priests in Rawat's case. He proclaimed his divine status himself on many occasions. One has only to read his speeches from DLM magazines from the time. I have a question. You have already resisted the use of Sophie Colliers book which was used here in a highly selective manner to illustrate how Rawat said to reporters that he was not God. What was omitted was the surrounding context which clearly indicated that Collier saw how Rawat spoke out of both sides of his mouth about such matters. Ie. gave his followers a far different impression.  (I argued ad nauseam about that).  Had someone then pointed out we can't use Collier because she's just a stoned follower then  that would have neatly solved that problem. (Actually I've read Collier and I thought her book was intelligent and honest).\nIn the past I limited my involvement here to trying to establish ground rules on what publications were permissable. I (unlike Momento and Ruminton} made the gesture of not editing until that was clear. That argument became entrenched and unclear despite Jossi's apparent' uber-clarity. Now we still have Ruminton and Momento warning everyone to observe BLP when editing here, as if they really know what that means. Frankly I think nobody really knows what these policies allow or disallow. Everyone (including neutral people with much experience) seems to have a different interpretation. Vassayana seemed to think that even Primary Sources were OK if used sensitively. I pointed out that the DLM magazines are available in many public libraries (ready public availability seemed to be a criteria). The devil is in the detail. What and whos 'sensitively is needed when using sources'?  Jossi, Ruminton and Momento always shout 'IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR' but I don't see it. They seem to exploit the vagueness to twist things to suit their own POV which, given their position as having strong views on the matter, is hardly surprising.  One thing that has never been established is what sources can be used. And if there is accord on that then these guys have the books. Do you or Will have them too?  How can you tell if stuff is cherry-picked if you don't have the books? Even when sources are approved they then argue that the people are expressing a minority view or it's not suitable for a BLP.  It's just a no win situation. Now Collier is not ok to use... once it was. Who decides eventually? |\n| 4 | Will Beback | This thread seems to have wondered far from its starting point. If I may make an observation about the suject and the DLM movement, there appears to have been a disconnect between what the subject said about himself and what his adherents, even the most senior followers, said about him. To boil it down, we have many quotes of him saying \"I'm not god\", and many quotes of his followers saying something like \"he's god\". This disconnect was so well known that he was asked about it during a press conference in 1973. As for the here and now, I perceive that some editors want to find proof that the subject called himself \"god\", while others want to disprove any such findings. My suggestion is to \"cover the controversy\". We should cover both what the subject said about himself and what his official followers said about him. Some of the latter may belong more in \"DLM\" or \"Teachings\", but it should be covered here too at least briefly. |\n| 5 | Jayen466 | I think this discussion suffers to some extent from the same old misunderstanding about the word \"God\", etc. In Eastern religion  Taoism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism  it is assumed that all so-called \"enlightened teachers\" are essentially the same. The inward reality of one is no different from that of any other (though their modes of expression may be, depending on the environment they find themselves in). You have the same idea in sufism \u2013 every sufi is supposed to be inwardly the same as any other, their inner realisation is the same (and sufis regard Jesus as a sufi ...). And from what I've read it is quite possible to have two sufi teachers teaching in close geographical proximity, each of them claiming to be the Qutb, which is kind of like the navel of the world. What has to be understood here is that the \"navel of the world\" is not a location, it is a ''quality'' that the teacher impersonates. It can be manifested in more than one place. Hence two teachers both claiming to be the Qutb are not necessarily in conflict (though their disciples may be) as to who is \"the real Qutb\". What matters is that each teacher is the Qutb, or centre of attention, to his disciples. Now as an encyclopedia we should exhibit at least a moderate familiarity with Eastern religious thought when it comes to articles in this field, and not play schoolboy pranks like \"he claimed he was Jesus\". The understanding of \"God\" in these religions is fundamentally different from that in exoteric Christianity (as pointed out by van der Lans and Schnabel).

Hence two teachers both claiming to be the Qutb are not necessarily in conflict (though their disciples may be) as to who is \"the real Qutb\". What matters is that each teacher is the Qutb, or centre of attention, to his disciples. Now as an encyclopedia we should exhibit at least a moderate familiarity with Eastern religious thought when it comes to articles in this field, and not play schoolboy pranks like \"he claimed he was Jesus\". The understanding of \"God\" in these religions is fundamentally different from that in exoteric Christianity (as pointed out by van der Lans and Schnabel). '''' |\n| 6 | Will Beback | Your observation about Eastern and particularly Hindu concepts of God seem correct. And this encyclopedia should try to give the most correct interpretations. The differing views may explain the differing statements made by the subject and his followers. It may be that Davis was not truly aware of the Eastern concept of god so he conflated it with his own Western concept of God. Anyway, it's not for us to go back and correct what Davis, et al., said. I again suggest that the way to handle this is to report what Rawat said about himself and what his followers said of him, even if they are contradictory. As a great Yankee philospher once said, \"when you come to a fork in the road, take it.\" |\n| 7 | Jayen466 | -)) Agreed, and well put. '''' |\n| 8 | Sylviecyn | Nah, Jayen, it's not about a misunderstanding of Eastern religious terminology.  Rawat has claimed he's greater than God all of the time from the time he came to the western countries.  People can claim that it was the mahatmas, but there were plenty of western initiators/instructors around the world, and that's what was taught, and Rawat hand-picked and trained those instructors intensively.  They were ''his'' agents.  This isn't about a confusion about eastern versus western definitions of \"God\" or \"Jesus,\" and this difficulty really has nothing to do with anyone's misconceptions about Eastern religious concepts versus western Judeo/Christian concepts about the terms \"God\" or \"Lord.\"  If you read the words of the English version of Arti that was sung in all of the western ashrams, communities, and to his face (in person when he was sitting on a stage) dressed up in the Krishna costume, it's more than obvious who he thinks he is and evidence enough of, not only his belief in his own divinity (greater than God) but that he encourages and has taught about his divinity throughout the 70s to the present day.  He just gave the press a very different response  he'd deny it.  The problem with this article is the same one that is found with many NRMs that have a living leader who is worshipped as divine:  The real truth isn't told about the leader's personal divinity when introduced to public, hence, there is one story told to the public, and the true story is told as people become indoctrinated towards receiving the techniques of Knowledge.  I can provide plenty of quotes of Rawat's that tell the story of how he promotes himself as God in a bod.  But, I'll then be accused of starting a \"quote war.\"  You won't get the real, true story out of adherents, because they're not allowed to discuss it anymore, especially in public. |\n| 9 | Momento | The full quote is \"God is great but Guru is greater than God because he reveals God\". |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5qW5iYh3zWEE6AD02MGW2NvZb5C", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930012, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3582, "completion_tokens": 88, "total_tokens": 3670}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Jayen466 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | Will Beback | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 7 | Jayen466 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 8 | Sylviecyn | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 9 | Momento | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

What I said was about the reference, exactly as follows: ''The good UK professor was writing a legal article as a Criminal Law Professor and diverted a small bit into American religion and American book publishing where he has no personal knowledge/experience and academic training.'' Nevertheless, as to the section you pointed out inserted by User:Onefortyone, read it and you will see that it epitomizes Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms and Wikipedia:No original research.\nYou also said: ''Biographical books that write unfavorable things certainly can be suppressed at one stage or other before publication. Surely the main reason is fear of litigation.'' |\n| 2 | Ted Wilkes |  |\n| 3 | Ted Wilkes |  |\n| 4 | Hoary | I'm connected via modem right now and thus shall limit comments to what I can say off the top of my head.\nIn the UK people can and do distinguish between \"conservative\" and \"Conservative\", \"republican\" and \"Republican\", and (so far as they are aware of the baleful concept and organization respectively) \"moral majority\" and \"Moral Majority\". Meanwhile, the ''Guardian'', like every publication working to meet tight deadlines, sometimes makes orthographic slips. (Er, you do as well. And I probably do too.)\nYou're welcome to point out what you see as \"significant errors and [misconceptions]\" by Wall, but to extrapolate from these to a claim that he has no expertise in the field whereof he writes is quite a jump: you thereby seem to be rating your own expertise in that field higher than the expertise of those that edit the journal. You may be justified in this, of course.\nOf ''The good UK professor was writing a legal article as a Criminal Law Professor and diverted a small bit into American religion and American book publishing where he has no personal knowledge/experience and academic training'': I still don't see anything about American religion, at least in the part quoted before  unless of course you insist that \"moral majority\" refers to the particular outfit headed by Falwell.\nWhat the First Amendment allows and what is actually allowed are somewhat different. I think you'll find that ''Favorite Son'', a work about the present \"Leader of the Free World\", was in effect suppressed, later emerging from another publisher. (By suppression of course I do not mean instructions from any organ of the state.)\n\"Elderly\" was hyperbolic; I meant retirees.\nI have occasionally wondered why 141 goes to such extremes to add far-fetched talk of bisexuality to the bios of US yoof stars of the 50s, but I really don't care. Also, I'm no long-distance psychiatrist. I just hope he tires of it.\nElvis's Wikipedia article isn't merely shorter than Madonna's; I think it's shorter than that for ''The Emancipation of Mimi'', merely the most recent CD by the ghastly Mariah Carey  an article that I rather enjoyed cleaning up a bit (I've no idea why; amateur psychiatrists are welcome to discuss this interesting case). |\n| 5 | Onefortyone | It is very interesting. Ted Wilkes is frequently including gossip stuff in this and related articles based on publications such as Priscilla Presley's book which was written by ghostwriters. On the other hand, he repeatedly accused me of not having cited peer-reviewed sources. Now I have written a new paragraph based on a peer-reviewed source and he again says it is not O.K. I think Ted Wilkes should carefully read what is written in the Wikipedia article on double standards. NB: You may rewrite parts of the new paragraph, but the whole thing should not be deleted.\nBy the way, here are some further publications by Professor Wall:\nWall, D.S. (1995) Reconstructing Elvis, Refereed Working Papers in Law and Popular Culture, Series Two, Number 2. Manchester: Manchester Institute for Popular Culture\nWall, D.S. (1996) 'Reconstructing the Soul of Elvis: The social development and legal maintenance of Elvis Presley as intellectual property,' International Journal of the Sociology of Law, vol. 24, pp. 117-143.\nWall, D.S.

No double standards there, 141. Meanwhile David Bret and Dee Presley have been discredited, here on this talk page, as sources. So in truth I don't find it very interesting, as you're wont to put. Given the single-minded nature of your edits and your endless wiki-lawyering (I'll stop there), your credibility even regarding the \"Elvis industry cabal\" is wearing rather thin. |\n| 7 | 80.141.238.225 | Are you really of the opinion that Priscilla Presley's gossip book is a reliable source?

You've clearly ignored the rules here and especially the above section is your original research by the information that you're not an authoritative figure from academic fields. Well, even many academics are very known for their altering history such as Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Don't you look biased and write from Chinese point of view? Yes, you do. ''\"Don't argue with you?\"'' Hmm.. you might've forgotten that Wikipedia is not owned by you. Your custom does not go by the same to Korean history. Plus, please refrain from pouring insulting comments. That does not make you feel good. |\n| 2 | Mosesconfuser | Appletrees, your talk show your ignorance of the content and history facts. Serious discussion about history is always welcome. I want to see more facts. I am willingly to admit I am wrong if I am convinced. However, as an administrator if you don't have interest in history, is it necessary to write your 'opinion' here? I already apologized for my violation of rules and thank for your neglecting my work after \"if\" in my sentence. I think a normal understanding of my word is I don't want to argue with people who don't have such knowledge and who don't put much effort on it. Once again, Chinese point of view is the 'only' point of view because all the historical articles about Korean Peninsula are written in Chinese before 13th century. The only way to eliminate 'bias' is to shorten Korean history to 13th century. So before that time, it should be called 'prehistory'.\nBy the way how much you know about Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences? Do you know the opinions of each party? Watch your mouth. Your comment is insulting and slanderous. There are too many political subjects there. But the research itself is always needed to solve real argument. That discussion are mostly between scholars. Also it's clearly a country's sovereignty to research the history on its land. I feel shame when I heard the scientific was interrupted under political reason. |\n| 3 | Kuebie | I've long given up trying to reason with Chinese internet nationalists. They do not present credible sources with the arguments they make, only amature interpretations of nebulous texts. Sorry wannabe scholars, you guys can muck around with your own history page but don't try to pervert Korean history to fit with your own fantasies. |\n| 4 | Kuebie | Book of later Han fragments the the people by kingdom and during that time Korea was not united. I don't see what your trying to prove.\nWang Man naming of Koguryo as Ha(low)guryo is merely Sino-centric self-satifaction.  Man enlisted Goguryeo forces to engage the Hsienpei (12 AD) Goguryeo had a change of heart and warred with the Chinese armies instead. Aahaha you claim to be historian yet you don't even understand the concept of terminological degradtion in chinese texts.\nWang-yeo, what the hell is that? My god, the Go house consolidated power during the reign of Taejo of Goguryeo. Power was exchanged from the Hae (Sono) to the Go (Kyeru). It is the Go house that conquered its neigbors, subjugated the Malgals, created the stele, and warred with China. It has absolutely nothing to do with your overly thought out and (quite laughable) useless naming theory which either way doesn't prove jacksquat. If your still unsure of about the usage and history of the name(s) of Goguryeo, feel free to ask . |\n| 5 | Mosesconfuser | I am really not sure about the usage of the name of Goguryeo from your side of story. What I want to say from Wang Man's story is the structure of word of \"GoGuryeo\". It prove the assertion of \"\"Goryeo\" is a short form of \"Goguryeo\"\" is wrong. Your argument seems not leave this argument too far. My conclusion is that assertion is a commonly believed but wrong statement. Can you give out any fact that prove I am wrong?

There are Four reverts in total by \nOnefortyone\nOnefortyone\n80.141.205.6\nOnefortyone |\n| 11 | Onefortyone | My opponents are frequently deleting the whole critical paragraph on the world-wide Elvis industry. As far as I can see, there is no consensus to exclude the whole thing from the Elvis article, as has been claimed by Wyss. The paragraph may be rewritten. Somebody else may add more details. But I think it is important to have a critical voice in the article. Here is again the disputed paragraph:\n==The world-wide Elvis industry==\nMost authors who are writing books and articles on Elvis are part of a worldwide Elvis industry which has a tendency towards supporting primarily a favorable view of the singer. Many of the stories about Elvis are written in order to feed the fans and to sell records or CDs. More than 2000 books have been published and the content of the majority of them could be characterized as based on gossip about gossip, only occasionally providing some new surprizing details. There are not many critical, unfavorable publications on Elvis's life. An example is Albert Goldman's controversial biography, ''Elvis'' (1981), in which the author unfavorably discusses the star's weight problems, his performing costumes and his excessive sex life. Some unfavorable voices sensationally claiming that Elvis had a sexual relationship with his mother or another man, that he raped his wife or had committed suicide because he had been suffering from bone-marrow cancer may have been motivated by money. All such publications are frequently disparaged and harshly attacked by Elvis fan groups. David S. Wall, BA, MA, M.Phil, PhD, Professor of Criminal Justice and Information Technology, has shown that one of the strategies of the worldwide Elvis industry is\n\" 'community policing' to achieve governance at a distance and typically effected through the various fan clubs and appreciation societies to which the bulk of Elvis fans belong. These organisations have, through their membership magazines, activities and sales operations, created a powerful moral majority that can be influenced in order to exercise its considerable economic power. Policing by mobilising the organic \u2018Elvis community\u2019 \u2013 the fan and fan club networks \u2013 has been achieved in a number of different ways, for example, when Dee Presley, nee Stanley, Elvis\u2019s former step-mother, wrote a supposedly whistle blowing account of Elvis\u2019s last years. The fan clubs refused to endorse the book and condemned it in their editorials. The combined effect of this economic action and negative publicity was ... the apparent withdrawal of the book. With a combined membership of millions, the fans form a formidable constituency of consumer power.\"\nI do not understand what should be wrong with this paragraph which is based on a peer-reviewed source. |\n| 12 | Onefortyone | I have now added some new passages on Elvis's death. These have also been deleted by  without commentary:\nThere was much discussion about the exact cause of Presley's death. When he died, his system contained traces of ten different drugs, including morphine and codeine. However, the doctors determined that \"hypertensive heart disease\" had caused the death. It should be pointed out that from late 1973 until his death, Elvis was in and out of hospitals, officially for treatment of pneumonia, exhaustion and other ailments. In truth, he was battling a long term dependence on prescription drugs, as well as weight problems. During 1975 and 1976 his performances were increasingly erratic. One Las Vegas engagement was canceled when he collapsed, in tears, on stage. Certainly drugs and gluttony contributed to his downward spiral.\nIndeed, Presley stands as a preeminent example of the dangers of excess. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5qWsMuWJ2QsVactSOoADlgrmMuN", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930012, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3730, "completion_tokens": 108, "total_tokens": 3838}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7 | 80.141.238.225 | Cold |\n| 8 | 129.241.134.241 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 9 | Ted Wilkes | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 10 | Ted Wilkes | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 11 | Onefortyone | Assured-Dominant |\n| 12 | Onefortyone | Unassuming-Ingenuous |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

All players give at least notice to the the premise and storyline because the mechanics are based so much on flavor (Ninjitsu, equipment, etc.).  The only group that perhaps comes close to ignoring the \"premise and stroyline\" are Pro Tour players, but that is a vast minority or players.  Above all, what is the point of the phrase?  It might be appropriate as a counter-point if the article were asserting the opposite viewpoint, but the player/storyline isn't mentioned anywhere in the article.  The second paragraph starts with \"In the game's primary fictional setting\". Boom. Right there the context of the planswalker idea is set in place, without saying anything about how players interact with it.\nI think the article doesn't need ''any'' comment about what players think of the \"premise and storyline\".  If I thought it did, I'd instead be pointing out how many fiction books are sold and describe the mechanic/flavor relationship to show that ''most'' players do follow the storyline. I just think your phrase is a personal viewpoint that doesn't have a place in the article.  Perhaps you could more neutrally state something like \"the game can be played without paying any attention to the storyline\".   Even so, you should add such a comment to the Storyline section or on Magic: The Gathering storylines.   \nIt serves the same purpose as the \"horned helmets\" section on Viking, that is to say, it's there to counter preconceptions that many readers have. The assumption that Magic is primarily played as a role-playing game is untrue, and more people who would want to play the game balk at it for that reason more than for others (like the expense). I know because I worked in a gaming store, and ran tournaments there, for three years (where I continue to play, while now owning an online store of my own). Through the store I personally know a few dozen regular Magic players, of a wide variety of ages, interests, and backgrounds. Most of them are not \"Pro Tour players,\" as you say, by any means, but I think no more than two or three of them would consider Magic \"roleplaying\" at all, or for that matter even give more than a passing thought to the art and flavor-text (the most visible fantasy elements in the game). It's flatly untrue that those who play the game so they can win tournaments are the only ones who entirely disregard the \"wizards casting spells\" premise. So no, I'm not inserting my own personal preference (personally, I enjoy the backstory to a small extent, though I don't play RPGs), I'm citing evidence, anecdotal but still observed by the eye of a salesman ''and'' enthusiast at a heavily trafficked gaming establishment over several years.\nWhile some game-relevant mechanics, like Ninjitsu or Equipment, are designed primarily from a perspective of flavor, this doesn't mean that's the way the players tend to view them. Very few of the 50-odd players I know would ever regard, say, Umezawa's Jitte in its capacity as the weapon of choice of a legendary rogue samurai; they considered the effect that it has on the game, and even the tiny minority who consider the card cool because it shows up in the novelized versions of the story play it first and foremost because it's a powerful card.\nI think my point can best be made by observing the reaction to an article posted on Magic's official website yesterday, as the first installment of what is to be a weekly column. The author started by rendering a few turns in a game of Magic into two written descriptions: a dry analysis using only mathematical terms, and a Dungeon-Master-style fantasy narration. His stated purpose was to show how much more interesting the latter is. However, in the several pages of responses which the article drew in the official forum, the majority of posters who stated a preference for one account over the other actually preferred the ''strategic analysis'', despite the author's efforts to make it unequivocally seem the less appealing choice. Another sizable faction said that what they visualize when they play Magic is something in-between, and neither a purely mathematical approach nor a role-playing game is their cup of tea. Those who actually enjoyed the \"Dungeon Master\" description were in the minority. The second paragraph of the Wikipedia article, as it stood, created a false impression about how Magic is most often played, and the observation that so many MagictheGathering.Com readers (who are often as far as can be from the \"Pro players\" to whom you referred) would prefer to entirely disregard role-playing as an element of the game stands to support all I've said.\nOut of respect for how well your work has improved this article overall, I will refrain from changing that paragraph back for the moment, and await your response. |\n| 2 | Netoholic | I am going to ask that you look at the overall balance of both the intro and the article on the whole.  This fairly subtle mention of the fictional setting ''does not'' speak about an role-playing aspects.  In fact, it states the opposite (\"bears little resemblance\").

This fairly subtle mention of the fictional setting ''does not'' speak about an role-playing aspects.  In fact, it states the opposite (\"bears little resemblance\").  I don't want to see the concept expanded, nor diminished.  I really think it is spot-on. |\n| 3 | Khaim | Netoholic, I see where you're coming from. However, I agree with Andrew that most players (including myself) see it as somewhat of a hybrid. That is, Magic is primarily a game, but does have flavorful aspects that make it more interesting. So while more players might prefer the \"dry numbers\" version of the game, as Andrew mentions, that's really choosing between two extremes. No one wants either.\nFurther, I think the second paragraph of the intro really is biased towards the role-playing/flavor aspect. That is ''not'' to say it should be removed. It needs to show the dynamic aspect we're talking about, that Magic is both a game and a setting. Actually, I'm more concerned about the opening lines of the gameplay section, which are completely biases towards flavor. Ask 100 Magic players what a planeswalker is, and maybe half of them will know, if that.\nHow about a compromise. We modify the second intro paragraph a little to better reflect what seems to be the majority opinion (meaning the Wizards board thread etc, not me and Andrew). We remove most or all mention of flavor from the gameplay section; it doesn't belong there anyway. And we change the tiny Storyline section into a new section dealing entirely with Magic's flavor, which can further expand upon the very issue we're discussing here. Would that be better? |\n| 4 | Khaim | Also, I'm going to cut the gameplay section down to size, unless someone does it for me. Hint, hint. |\n| 5 | Netoholic | First of all, respondents to the recent Flavor article on the WotC board is not a \"majority opinion\".  Readers of that website are primarily Spikes, and the comments on the board were more criticizing for the extremist approach of that article, not a general commentary on flavor in the game.  Please don't extend so much validity to what you percieve from those boards.\n Secondly, there is absolutely no bias in the second paragraph. Noone disputes that \"in the primary fictional setting\" which the game is based on, it is a fantasy battle between planeswalkers. That is factually established, and that paragraph does not promote that view.  Andrew Levine's phrasing onthe other hand, pointedly ''shoots down'' that view by using unsourced comments.\n Third, the existing gameplay section is about the right size and detail.  For this article to stand-alone, it is needed.  Sub-articles are used to provide more detail on a subject, not so that key information and context can be moved out of the article.  Every article should make sense when read all by itself.  If they don't, we are failing. |\n| 6 | Khaim | I have to disagree here. While the sentences themselves are true in every way, it is the manner in which they are presented that is problematic. Namely, they draw attention to the flavor-side aspects of the game. That's not a bad thing per se, but as currently written it appears to be much more important than it is.\nThe gameplay section needs an overhaul. (Note: When I say \"gameplay section\", I mean the stuff between \"Game play\" and \"Deck Construction\".) For one thing, it's badly written, and I mean that purely objectively. It's hard to understand, even for me, and I already know what it's talking about! For someone who doesn't know the terms already, I suspect it's pure gibberish. Specifically:\nThe six types of cards aren't really relevant to understanding the basic of the game. They are laid out in detail on the rules page; they don't need more than a passing mention here.\nThe paragraph beginning with \"during each turn\" is a mess of long, tangled sentences. There is some important information there, but it's lost in the jumble of keywords, parentheses, and conditionals.\nThe stack is ''very'' complex. A large chunk of the rules page is devoted to explaining it.\nI think everything that's discussed in this section merits being there. The issue is the level of detail and manner of presenting. Currently the material is badly presented and given what I consider too much detail. The article should mention the stack, and how it resolves timing issues; they do not need to know the details of how it works. That should be reserved for the Magic: The Gathering rules article. |\n| 7 | Khaim | Excuse me? What is this?

The simple point is that a Clip is not a Magazine and a Magazine is not a Clip.  I think it's too much as written in the current version of the article.  It's absurd to go this far.  Wait, that's what I said to begin with. |\n| 3 | Jclemens | Do you think the controversy would be better off in a separate article, discussed at length, with just a summary and a reference to it in this article? |\n| 4 | Asams10 | The controversy is contrived and petty.  There is no controversy.  The terms Clip and Magazine mean two different things.  There is a small contingent of liberals (in the strict sense) that want to let Hollywood and ignorant people decide that the terms are interchangeable.  Scot, not that I am trying to be disrespectful, but I am tempted to dismiss a translation of a French manual as a good source for usage of the English language.  Also, there is nothing \"modern\" about 1911.  The term \"Magazine\" has been used consistently by the US Military since the adoption of detatchable magazine firearms.  (correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't the M1911 the first detatchable magazine small arm adopted?).  Further, as firearms for public consumption almost exclusively are sans clip-loading capability, the term was not in general use outside of the US Military until later on.  Specifically, the term clip was widely used during WWII to describe the en-bloc (as opposed to moon clip or stripper clip) clips.  There is not a continuity, therefore, between pre-WWI usage and post WWII usage of the term.  It appears that there was enough of an issue during the Korean war that the two terms were being misused, that training was specific and blunt about the differences. |\n| 5 | Fluzwup | Actually, I think I can address all of these concerns with one simple change.  The article as it stands has nothing on the HISTORY of the magazine.  When did it appear?  How did it change from the Volcanic rifle to the H&K; G11?  By addressing the evolution of the magazine over time, I think the issue of terminology will blend right in.  This 1880 encyclopedia has a several page long article on the magazine-rifle, starting with superposed loads; covering the Volcanic, the Spencer, the Winchester, and various adaptations of those designs, such as versions with 2 up to 7 magazine tubes.  It covers the issue of rimfire vs. centerfire cartridges in the (at the time) ubiquitous tube magazines, and notes that even the rimfire Spencer had detonation problems. It covers spring-fed magazines, gravity fed magazines, and mechanically actuated magazines, such as later used in the Lewis gun (so there's that issue resolved).  This is all interesting information to put in a history section, and will fill it out so the whole clip vs. magazine is just a blip that occurred when people were in search of the correct choice to use for those new-fangled detachable magazines. |\n| 6 | CrimsonSage | I think that we have now seen enough references, articles, etc., etc., to say that interchanging the terms 'clip' and 'magazine' is 'not' incorrect.  That, there are only 'inexact' definitions of both these terms and that there is a debate as to the actual technical meanings. In addition, we know that in both common usage and modern parlance, the terms are interchanged.  There is plenty of history and references to back all of this up.  I am in reasonable agreement with the compromise language that we all agreed on (the singular exception of Asamuel).  Asamuel has his own 'religious' beliefs about the terms which simply 'do not agree' with the facts or with history, period.  We have proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that there is both a controversy, and there are also 'no' precise definitions for these terms.  And even Asamuel, through his own contradictions, points to the fact that these terms were both contentious and different thoughout history. Like I said before, we must note that there are actually only 'very loose' and 'inexact' definitions currently.  Now, with all that said, I do agree that putting in a solid history section would be a great reference for researcher. But, I want to ensure that we do not overstep ourselves in forcing supposedly precise definitions that simply don't exist (I have no problem with noting the numerous varying definitions and references, however, as I've explained several times). |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5quOkTAzNd3t0CkpQysC4AM5Hth", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930036, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3608, "completion_tokens": 99, "total_tokens": 3707}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Fluzwup | Aloof-Introverted |\n| 2 | Asams10 | Cold |\n| 3 | Jclemens | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 4 | Asams10 | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 5 | Fluzwup | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | CrimsonSage | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

He's putting forth a reasoned view, and one that I share based on my own considerable research on the subject. You are the one being dogmatic here and you are staking your entire position on the notion that imprecise usage of a term makes that usage valid if it becomes commonplace enough. That is in fact a way that some dictionaries will add new definitions to words, i.e., when improper use becomes ''accepted'', then the usage ceases to be improper. However, that is the way things work for colloquial speech, not scientific or technical terms. Such terms rarely become accepted through misuse. This article is about a technical subjecta specific mechanical device used with a firearm. As such, it merits treatment as a technical article where terms are afforded precise meanings. That does not mean that the article should not state the common misuse of clip for magazine. But to state that the terms are 'interchangeable' is just wrong. They are frequently interchanged, but they are not interchangeable. As I stated in a comment above, they empirically cannot be interchangeable because in certain applications, a clip forms a part of working magazine unit. But they are two quite different parts. Saying you could call the magazine a clip in this application renders the terms meaningless and hopelessly confused. Do you also maintain that the definition of cartridge and bullet are interchangeable because cartridges are routinely misnamed bullets by the uninformed? |\n| 8 | Jclemens | Any encyclopedic article about 'bullet' that ignored the common use equating it with a cartdridge would do a disservice to the reader.  Firearms are NOT devoid of cultural context.  If some thug waves a 'gat' in your face, are you going to protest that it's really just a semi-automatic handgun and that he's using the wrong word during a mugging? Firearms technical articles should indeed use technical terms in precise measures... but Wikipedia is a general purpose encyclopedia.  Encyclopedias, like dictionaries, should discuss common usage, if only to compare and contrast it with precise technical usage. |\n| 9 | Asams10 | \"...compromise language that we all agreed on (the singular exception of Asamuel).\"  What?

However, there is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably, and that an unprecedented collective effort is needed to return human use of natural resources to within sustainable limits. So, in recent times the idea of human sustainability has become increasingly associated with the United Nations global program for sustainable development expressed as \u201cmeeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" To safeguard the interests of future generations, fundamental changes are needed in the economic, social and environmental spheres.\nIs this what was intended?  We have lost several important references. Overall, it seems thin for a lead for an FA.  \nRevised revised version\nI know this is extremely irritating after so much work but as I re-read the above lead I find there are, to my mind, still logical difficulties and minor inaccuracies - and it could be written in a more user-friendly style. I have, in the light of Sunray\u2019s comment and the Wikipedia advice on FA leads edited the lead mercilessly to what I would prefer, reducing it to 3 paragraphs, also added references. This is cheeky, so I will not be in the least bit offended if changes are reverted and further modifications made as we head towards consensus.

It is now regarded as a guiding principle for  managing human organizations concepts, such as ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities, human activities and disciplines sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture green building and new technologies such as the encouragement of renewable energy systems. As such, sustainability is sometimes seen as the most recent progression of the latest technologies of various human systems and thought most innovative thinking across various disciplines and fields.

I confess I have been only broadly aware of these. Sunray has drawn our attention to them several times. I\u2019ve copied the main opening points here:\n The lead serves both as an introduction to the article below and as a short, independent summary of the important aspects of the article's topic. The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article. It should establish context, explain |\n| 2 | Nick carson | I'm happy with all that. I this is the best version of the opening sentence. I've added one sentence pertaining to sustianability as a recent progression of human technologies, ideas and systems. This was indeed iterating GT, but worth it, much better than before. |\n| 3 | Sunray | I think your addition at the end of paragraph 2 works well, Nick. I've tweaked it a bit. I tend to agree with you about \"most\" in the second sentence and have restored that. '''But''' I think that we are being a mite picky with our edits. Probably not a bad thing right now, as we get to know one another, but we will probably need to elect an editor-in-chief when we get further along.\nWe should probably let this sit for now. I suggest that we just leave it here for awhile and go on to other sections. We will definitely have other ideas as the article evolves and we should then take another look at the FA criteria and revise it accordingly. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5r7Ov0fx0GmEO6Xz1NULNAVnCaD", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930049, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3809, "completion_tokens": 55, "total_tokens": 3864}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Sunray | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Nick carson | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Sunray | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

God directly creates lion F and lion M. If you get directly created by God, you have no common ancestry. So both these lions have no common ancestry. So though they're part of the same kind, they're part of differing baramins. So either our lead sentence is wrong, or a test for no-ancestry is not a test for kind and baraminology is misguided. I suspect it's the latter, but perhaps there's an explanation. (If the explanation is that the lions were conjoined, or self-fertilizing (a trait lost immediately to inbreeding), then I too may 'check out'.) |\n| 2 | Ungtss | That's part of the problem.  There's no way to know how many of each \"kind\" were originally created.  Could have been 2.  Could have been 2,000,000.  Of course, UCD has the same ambiguity here  it's not clear whether we're descended from a single individual, or from a single gene pool (e.g. multiple protoorganisms that arose spontaneously under the same conditions).  At this point, all baraminology is trying to do is figure out who's part of the same ancient gene pool, and who's not.  UCD skipped that step, and assumed (without falsifiable experiment) that all organisms on the planet share common descent.  The real project of baraminology is to track descent back to the ''gene pools'' that stepped off the ark.  For example, ostensibly 14 members of the ''feline'' kind would have stepped off, and subsequently interbred.  Were they related?  We can't really know.  But baraminology is trying to find ways to figure out how many of today's species descended from the feline kind's gene pool. |\n| 3 | Hrafn | This is related to a misperception about evolution/paleontology  the frequently used term 'common ancestor' does not refer to an individual, but to a common ancestral population (each of who individually may or may not be common ancestors to current-day individuals). ''Populations evolve  individuals don't.'' The only self-consistent definition would be to define \"kind\" as \"population (of two or more individuals, for kinds that have sexual repreoduction) that were created by God to reproductively compatible\" (or similar). The problem with this (apart from the fact that it is OR)  is that it allows universal common descent as a limiting case. Ungtss's claims would appear to be demonstrably false. I know of no 'experimental genetic baraminology' into ancestral gene pools  as far as I can see, baraminology is purely an 'armchair' or 'Monday morning quaterbacking' field  involving the procrustian manipulation of pre-existing scientifc evidence to fit Biblical preconceptions. It has been repeatedly falsified by evidence of common descent that ''cross'' barminological lines (such that barminologists introduce explicit barminological rules stating that Bible interpretation trumps scientific evidence). One blatant example would be the ''compelling'' evidence of common descent of man and ape. UCD is '''''NOT''''' an unfalsifiable assumption, but rather a scientific hypothesis that has stood up to a wealth of new genetic data that has failed to falsify it, and is thus a scientific theory (and part of the Theory of Evolution). '''Every''' experiment/analysis that has involved genetic comparison of believed-to-be-related populations has been potentially a falsification of UCD. but the fact of the matter is that these are far more likely to turn up an unexpected close relationship than an unexpectedly distant one  and none have turned up no sign at all of a relationship. '''' |\n| 4 | Ungtss | This is off-topic.  If you'd like to present a single experiment that could have falsified UCD, I'd love to read about it and discuss it on my talkpage, but not here.  The answer to M's question is \"the lead sentence is wrong  baraminology defines the \"kind\" (for our purposes, anyway  post-flood) as a gene pool of somewhere between 2 and 14 individuals per kind, and not descent from a single individual.  Tracking back to the original antediluvian kinds is virtually impossible, but the noahic kinds can be expected to have strongly resembled them.\" |\n| 5 | Hrafn | Your demand for a \"single experiment\" shows a ''gross'' misunderstanding of how science works  but then Creationists are always happy to criticise what they don't understand. Falsifiability does not require the existence of an 'all or nothing' single experiment, merely testable predictions (which UCD provides, in spades). It does not even require laboratory experiments at all  merely that the predictions can be tested against future ''observations'' (be they lab experiment or field observations, singular or part of a large set). Your noahic kinds\" simplification ignores the vast range of purely aquatic species that would not have gone onto the purported ark  as well as plants (and probably a few other categories). In any case, this definition appears to be WP:OR, unless you can cite a WP:RS that articulates it. Incidentally, where is the genetic evidence that the ultimate population was 2-14 individuals, and how does this hypothesis explain (i) how such tiny (and thus genetically non-viable) populations survived in-breeding and (ii) the ''massive'' mutation needed to turn such a small gene pool into the enormous genetic diversity that modern science has documented?

Falsifiability does not require the existence of an 'all or nothing' single experiment, merely testable predictions (which UCD provides, in spades). It does not even require laboratory experiments at all  merely that the predictions can be tested against future ''observations'' (be they lab experiment or field observations, singular or part of a large set). Your noahic kinds\" simplification ignores the vast range of purely aquatic species that would not have gone onto the purported ark  as well as plants (and probably a few other categories). In any case, this definition appears to be WP:OR, unless you can cite a WP:RS that articulates it. Incidentally, where is the genetic evidence that the ultimate population was 2-14 individuals, and how does this hypothesis explain (i) how such tiny (and thus genetically non-viable) populations survived in-breeding and (ii) the ''massive'' mutation needed to turn such a small gene pool into the enormous genetic diversity that modern science has documented?

My point is that Obama is 100% depicted alongside Republicans. If you are comfortable with that then I think you have made yourself clear.  I think it is ironic that you bring up Bush's page here yet every time I have seen someone do that they are shot down for discussing a different page.  Kind of funny, huh.  Again, Obama is depicted only with Reps , the one photo for all the presidents getting together has him next to the republicans, etc, etc.  You said they had to be notable, yet one of the Rep's didn't co sponsor anything with Obama at all.  My point is clear, and if you look at the photos you can tell that there is purposeful posing of Obama with only Rep's. Period. that is not balanced. You didn't show that the other pages followed this pattern (however off topic that has been declared here) at all.  in fact, none of those men were senators so that is why they are not posing with them (nor with the opposite party).  ON a page like this which is manicured to the follicle it is hard to believe that all of these pictures are giant coincidence and they just couldn't find any with him and his own party.  By the way, thank you for continually insulting me.   JohnHistory |\n| 8 | JohnHistory | How do you get away with acting like this?

Things like this, however subtle, undermine the integrity of the article because they suggest a deliberate effort to portray the president in a certain light that they find advantageous to him politically. The point is that it doesn't make sense to show Obama with only Republican senators, and not a single democratic senator.    JohnHistory |\n| 2 | Cameron Scott | There are em.. two such pictures, one of which is him with someone he co-sponsored a bill with. If you have some suggestions for some alternatives pictures, don't hold back - let's hear them. |\n| 3 | Abrazame | Cameron, I think you misunderstand John.  He's lusting to see a photo of a ''Democrat'', and Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter don't satiate him.  John, how about you tell us which is your favorite Democratic senator.  As with the photos of Republicans in this article, it has to be someone notable for doing something positive in conjunction with the president, signifying something greater than just eye candy.  Your candidates? |\n| 4 | JohnHistory | Please do not denigrate me. Can't we just discuss the issue without personal conjecture?  I think Obama with Ted Kennedy (that was seen as a key endorsement) or Obama with one of his fellow Dem colleagues and leaders like Pelosi or Reid would be more balanced then 100% republicans. By the way, Carter and Clinton are not senators that served with Obama.  Ironically, even the photo you are talking about has Obama sandwhiched in between both the Bush presidents not next to carter or CLinton.    JohnHistory |\n| 5 | Soxwon |  |\n| 6 | Abrazame | I suppose I apologize.  You came in here full tilt imagining some conspiracy, fast and furious three times in the face of reverts.  I took you for a lunatic stridently pushing a POV agenda.  Pelosi and Reid preceded Obama in their posts.  I don't see how Obama's interaction with either is particularly notable or that they have yet accomplished anything specific together.  You will note that no current Republican officeholder is pictured in the article, for the same reason.  My point remains: photos are not presented for eye candy, rather, they show notable moments that illustrate the uniqueness of the article subject.\nPrecisely for the obvious reason you stated, there is already a shot of Obama with Ted Kennedy in Barack Obama presidential primary campaign, 2008.  There are two shots with Joe Biden in Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008.  There is a striking shot of him with Biden and Hillary Clinton as he signs the Lilly Ledbetter Act in the presence of its namesake.  2008 Democratic National Convention features shots of Barbara Mikulski and another of Clinton and one with Obama and the Biden family.\nI'm sure that as Obama's young term gets underway there will be notable moments with colleagues of his own party, and editors eager to include them pictorially as is deemed notable to his bio (again, as distinguished from the myriad articles about those issues themselves).  In Bill Clinton's article, there are three pictures of him with the Bushes, one with the Reagans and none with any senators from either party.  Jimmy Carter's bio has three shots with various Bushes and no senators.  By contrast, both Presidents Bush articles have many more photos of Bushes (kidding) I mean they each have only one photo of any Democrat, and the senators are few and far between.  This isn't a requirement.  Neither is it a taboo, nor a conspiracy.  If, as you seem to suggest, Obama is intending to send a message by purposely sidling up to Republicans at every turn, then our searching for stock footage of inadvertent encounters in hallways with Democrats isn't serving the public with the true story, is it?  One does not achieve balance in an article by creating it artificially for its own sake.  If you don't want Obama to seem extraordinarily bipartisan\u2014if he is not extraordinarily bipartisan\u2014how about adding pics of some notable collaborations with Dems to the Bush articles? |\n| 7 | 76.119.231.88 | First of all, wasn't this archived so that I couldn't talk?  My point is that Obama is 100% depicted alongside Republicans. If you are comfortable with that then I think you have made yourself clear.  I think it is ironic that you bring up Bush's page here yet every time I have seen someone do that they are shot down for discussing a different page.  Kind of funny, huh.  Again, Obama is depicted only with Reps , the one photo for all the presidents getting together has him next to the republicans, etc, etc.  You said they had to be notable, yet one of the Rep's didn't co sponsor anything with Obama at all.  My point is clear, and if you look at the photos you can tell that there is purposeful posing of Obama with only Rep's. Period. that is not balanced. You didn't show that the other pages followed this pattern (however off topic that has been declared here) at all.  in fact, none of those men were senators so that is why they are not posing with them (nor with the opposite party).  ON a page like this which is manicured to the follicle it is hard to believe that all of these pictures are giant coincidence and they just couldn't find any with him and his own party.

Secondly the IPA pronunciations previously indicated showed a pronunciation that was directly regular from the spelling (ie con-a-chu-var), but no sources for this were given. In Co. Cork at least, the pronunciation of the name, however spelt, is Croch\u00far. I have cited a source: the Irish of West Muskerry, 1943, by Briain \u00d3 Cu\u00edv p128. Note the pronunciation Croch\u00far is also given for Galway in the book The Irish of Cois Fhairrge, and it is given for Mayo in the book The Irish of Erris, Co. Mayo. I would take a LOT of convincing that it was anything else in Donegal Irish either. The pronunciation of cr for cn is normal in Donegal Irish anyway. This name is NOT pronounced con-a-chu-var - not by native speakers of Irish anyway. The northern dialects (Galway, Mayo and Donegal) probably swing the accent to the front of the word: /'krohu:r/. I have indicated /kr\u0259'hu:r/ for Cork, but I am not sure whether it should be /kro'hu:r/ with o instead of \u0259. Please edit if you know (know, not think). |\n| 2 | Akerbeltz | Whoa, slow down. My last comment was merely a long question, not an accusation. However, having read your answer, it raises the question of whether these dialect pronunciations are appropriate for a proncunciation guide on Wikipedia. Most pronunciation guides aim for what whicheve language considers a mid-ground/standard (whatever you want to call it) pronunciation. For Irish that would be, love it or hate it, the L\u00e1rchan\u00faint - which works off the spelling more than it doesn't. This does not imply the dialect pronunciations don't have their place on the page but I am doubtful about elevating any dialect, be it Ulster Munster or Connacht to that of a standard pronunciation. |\n| 3 | Djwebb1969 | Akerbeltz, Irish is spoken as a native language by the inhabitants of the Gaeltacht. The L\u00e1rchan\u00faint has precizely 0 (zero, nada, zilch, zip) native speakers. It was an artificial thing created by a government committee. Including recommending pronouncing anois (\"now\") as /\u0259'no\u0283/. Of course, \"oi\" can be pronounced e, i or o in Irish, but the committee decided to \"simplify\" and make it always o in the L\u00e1rchan\u00faint. Allow me to institute a \"Central Dialect\" of English, which you may like to employ on Wikipedia: gh has many pronounciations, so my \"rule\" is always pronounce it \"f\". Through, though, bough - must always be \"f\". Do you get the \"methodology\"? There is no standard pronunciation of Irish - and the L\u00e1rchan\u00faint is not a standard pronunciation of Irish. I just pointed out - get an IQ test before you read my comment above - that in every dialect that I could find evidence for, the pronunciation of Conchubhar is as Croch\u00far. In some dialects the stress on Croch\u00far would be on the first and in other dialects on the second syllable. But as far as I know, there are zero native speakers who pronounce this word Conchubhar. You say \"I am doubtful about elevating any dialect, be it Ulster Munster or Connacht to that of a standard pronunciation.\" That is a deceitful comment. Rather, you want to elevate a pronunciation not use in Ulster, Munster or Connaught to the status of a standard, overriding the pronunciations used by every single native speaker of Irish. |\n| 4 | Akerbeltz | The regularity of the Goidelic spelling systems (minus Manx) cannot be compared to that of English so I'll ignore that comparison with \"gh\". Except to point out that English pronunciation on Wikipedia DOES follow a central-ish pronunciation. None of the pages on the American Southwest for example elevate South-Western US English to that of being standard pronunciation indicated. What Wikipedia doesn't do is establish text to phoneme rules but then, the pronunciation of English is well documented.\nCan I also point out to you that virtually ANY language standard on this planet is \"artificial\"? Standard German was not a \"natural language\", Standard Basque wasn't either, French is based on Parisian French but it is not totally equivalant to. So the argument that the L\u00e1rchan\u00faint was never a naturally spoken variant is irrelevant. The question is whether L\u00e1rchan\u00faint is in any shape or form an officially sanctioned pronunciation for the language. Whether you love it or hate it is, fortunately, beside the point too. People didn't love Batua at first either.\nThirdly, there's no need to stoop to insulting people. I made a neutral enquiry so how about you calm down a bit? |\n| 5 | Akerbeltz | PS \"Croohur\" is hardly a precise transcription but I'll ask Ciar\u00e1n... |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5rgiYSMSSuXFfIqssl7gj5TA5fa", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930084, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3712, "completion_tokens": 89, "total_tokens": 3801}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Djwebb1969 | Assured-Dominant |\n| 2 | Akerbeltz | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Djwebb1969 | Cold |\n| 4 | Akerbeltz | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 5 | Akerbeltz | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

I did a bit of reading and it would appear that there are spellings (perhaps not as mainstream) that reflect the modern pronunciation better. O' Rahilly in Irish Dialects Past and Present states \"The change of n to r is undoubtedly a relatively late one. [...] 'Knochor' (Tyrone and Down, 1602), otherwise 'Connchor' (Armagh, 1602), for ''Cnoch\u00far'', ''Conch\u00far'', earlier ''Conchobhar''.\" There's also Stair na Gaeilge which says in the Munster section \"D\u00e9antar cr de cn ( |\n| 7 | Djwebb1969 | You turn this into a constant talking around the subject. The L\u00e1rchan\u00faint was a stillborn attempt to create a standard pronunciation that fell flat on its face due to its absurd approach. As I have pointed out, some of the pronunciations in Focl\u00f3ir P\u00f3ca are not used by a single native speaker of Irish, eg that of \"anois\". The Irish state does not have the authority to \"sanction\" a pronunciation for Irish. Irish pronunciation is just what it is. Maybe standard pronunciations are not necessarily fully descriptive, being partly prescriptive, but if the standards verge too far away from any real pronunciation, they lose their ability to function as standards. I don't think there is any pronunciation in standard French that could be described as not used by a single French speaker, as I explained with \"anois\". One could compare Standard Mandarin - and it is not my function to provide you with a free of charge education - but let me fill you in on the details. Standard putonghua is not exactly the same as Peking dialect, although there are some areas said to be much closer to the prescribed standard than Peking itself. Changchun is one - maybe reflecting the settlement of the north-east quite late in Chinese history. Chengde is also often mentioned as a place with a pronunciation closer to the prescribed standard than Peking. Shenzhen is another example, owing to its settlement in recent decades by people from all over the country. Be that as it may, the putonghua pronunciation is not entirely artificial. Before 1924, a \"state sanctioned\" standard pronunciation of Chinese that was entirely artificial was created, including reviving the \"entering tone\" no longer used in Mandarin. It contained elements from various dialects, but was entirely the creation of a linguist, who produced LP records of this pronunciation and was the only person in China capable of producing it! Finally, after 1924, the attempt to create an artificial standard was abandoned, and the standard was created much close to Peking dialect, although not 100% the same either. The L\u00e1rchan\u00faint is the equivalent of the pre-1924 attempt to make an artificial standard not spoken by anyone and not based on real speech. |\n| 8 | Djwebb1969 | Haha! That is SO funny! Your reading on the subject leads you to the view that modern pronunciation of Conchubhar is Cnoch\u00far/Croch\u00far. So you were wrong. Eat humble pie!

Stellarkid's sole purpose at this article has been to edit war out a name that he does not like. Users have said that they accept that it has been used as a name but they want to remove it because it is \"defamatory\" to Israel. There has been a consistent push to eliminate a significant POV, which NPOV requires we include, by a set of editors. It is difficult to restrain myself to just allow that set of editors to continually remove something that they find personally objectionable. I find many things that are cited to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs objectionable, but I have not removed them, in fact I have put them in and reverted to keep them in.

Iraq is not a completely modern term at all, the Iraqis have called their land \"Iraq\" since antiquity, since at least Sassanid times, this is attested. As a matter of fact, \"Mesopotamia\" is the invented term for Ancient Iraq because Iraq was under Ottoman rule in the 19th century when European archaeologists began exploring in Iraq. Now Iraq is a sovereign state (and helped the Allies defeat the Ottoman Empire to gain independance). Actually, \"Greece\" did not exist in ancient times, there was the Delian League, Macedonia, Sparta, the Hellenistic civilization, etc. \"Iran\" did not exist, there was Elam, Medes, and various Persian empires. \"China\" consisted of lots of small dynasties. And if you're going to now try and shift your argument to language, the modern Egyptians don't speak Ancient Egyptian. I would advise you to be careful when discussing cultural matters Taivo. Cultural imperialism and insensitivity cause offense. I have offered a compromise where both terms can be used. Try not to ignore responses too, you seem to have ignored much of what I explained in my previous comment. Izzedine |\n| 7 | Izzedine | , or preferably only for times after 1921.\nWhy? Because this is English Wikipedia, not Arabic Wikipedia. The meaning of Arabic '' \u02bfIr\u0101q ''\nis irrelevant for usage of English Iraq, which is a loanword and as such does not necessarily have the same meaning as the source term in the original language. The OED defines the meaning of the English term ''Iraqi'' as \"A native or inhabitant of Iraq, a republic in the Persian Gulf, formerly (before 23 Aug. 1921) known as Mesopotamia\", unambiguously stating that in English usage, \"Mesopotamia\" is the term of choice for referring to the region in contexts of periods predating 1921.

There is no such thing as \"Ancient Iraq\"it was \"Mesopotamia\" or part of the \"Near East\".  Iraq came into being in the modern era.  Assyria and Babylonia extended outside the boundaries of modern Iraq (as did the Akkadian Empire), so equating these regions with the boundaries of the modern country is not accurate.  The most common usage among historians, etc., for this region is Near East or Mesopotamia (the latter term is less Eurocentric if that is a concern).  (  ) |\n| 2 | Izzedine | Tell me why it is acceptable to use the terms '''Ancient Egypt''', '''Ancient Greece''', '''Ancient Iran''' and '''Ancient China''', but not '''Ancient Iraq'''?\n1. Sumer was entirely within Iraq. \n2. Akkad was in Iraq.  (not the empire)\n3. Babylonia was virtually entirely within Iraq.   (not the empire)\n4. Assyria the vast majority of it was in Iraq.  (Not the empire)\nThe argument that there was minor overspill of Iraq's borders is a nonsense. \"Ancient Greece\" wasn't a single state and absolutely did not correspond to modern Greece's exact borders, nor did \"Ancient Egypt\" correspond to modern Egypt's exact borders, nor did \"Ancient China\", nor did any of them. As a matter of fact, modern Iraq corresponds with its ancient states to a sharply greater extant than many other countries. This is Iraqi history. You cannot use the extant of empires as an argument because expansion is a function of empires, the empires originated in and were ruled from Iraq, they were Ancient Iraqi empires - in the context of the modern unified Iraq. The Egyptian Empire extended outside of Egypt, Ancient Greece used to cover the western half of Anatolia, the Greek empires extended far outside of modern Greece, and so on.\nSimply because there wasn't a state called Iraq doesn't make an argument (notwithstanding the city of Uruk is thought to be the etymological origin of Iraq), because there wasn't a state called Egypt either, or Greece, or China, or \"Mesopotamia\". I've never seen any evidence that the so-called \"Babylonians\" called their country \"Babylonia\". The term \"Ancient Iraq\" is widely-used interchangeably with \"Mesopotamia\" ,,,,. Granted, Mesopotamia is the more prevalent term, but using both terms only adds context and is square scholarship. Izzedine |\n| 3 | TaivoLinguist | Ancient Iraq did not exist.  Indeed, when you click on the link to \"Ancient Iraq\" it goes to Mesopotamia.  Greece, Egypt, China, and Iran/Persia all actually existed in one form or another in ancient times (and were actually ''called'' by those names).  Iraq did not exist.  Look at the published histories of the ancient world and you will not find the term \"Iraq\" except as a reference to the modern country and modern boundaries.  The books you googled all speak of the ancient world in reference to the modern country and its boundaries, ''not'' to an ancient entity.  We could just as easily write a book about \"Ancient Andorra\" which described Paleo- and Neolithic sites.  \"Iraq\" did not exist in ancient times, unlike Greece, Egypt, China, and Persia.  And, to remind you, the \"usually called Mesopotamia\" should be a clue to you that common usage is Mesopotamia.  And, as well, Mesopotamia also encompasses eastern Turkey, western Iran, and eastern Syria.  This is a well-known, widely-understood, and more commonly occurring term than \"ancient Iraq\", going back to usages 2500 years ago.  \"Iraq\" is a completely modern term. (  ) |\n| 4 | Dbachmann | has been warned numerous times about inserting \"Iraq\" anachronistically. He simply Will Not Listen, apparently because his patriotic fervour shuts out all other considerations. Imho it would be adequate to move from warnings to actual sanctions at this point. |\n| 5 | Dbachmann | In reality, it is fair to use \"Iraq\" for periods after about AD 1200, but in medieval times the term must be used with care, as it was not coterminous with the area of modern Iraq, there was \u02bfIr\u0101q \u02bfArab\u012b and \u02bfIr\u0101q \u02bfajam\u012b, which included much of modern Iraq and als much of modern western Iran, but not modern Northern Iraq.\n\"Iraq\" can only be used unambiguosly and without debate from periods after AD 1700 or so |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5sAgYeOJGXIb7c4pl0VW46hOfUT", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930114, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3665, "completion_tokens": 86, "total_tokens": 3751}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | TaivoLinguist | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Izzedine | Assured-Dominant |\n| 3 | TaivoLinguist | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 4 | Dbachmann | Cold |\n| 5 | Dbachmann | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

A reliable source supporting a statement that a group holds an opinion must accurately describe how large this group is''.\"(More at link )\nThere's more along these lines at WP:UNDUE |\n| 5 | Astynax | There has been a great deal of poisoning the well regarding sources, tracing far back in the discussions, well before my involvement beginning last March. One user who has posted using multiple accounts and IP's has shopped his unsupported theories as to all and/or most sources being non-RS and/or SPS to several WP forums, as well as using that rationalization to argue for having this and related articles Afd'd. There have also been assertions that all the sources are subjective opinions and/or that they are sloppy research in which authors parrot a few old and hostile sources. No backup for these tendentious statements have yet been given, just more unsupported aspersions. Similarly, suggestions have been made to forego citing sources and open up the article to unsupported statements. I have long since found it difficult to assume good faith in such tactics, particularly on the part of editors who would \"rather see no article\" and who dispute well-documented and obvious facts based upon hypercritical parsing (i.e., someone, somewhere, somehow may or may not hold or have expressed a different view\u2014extrapolating a supposed or possible exception in an attempt to invalidate a statement of a normative view or practice).\nAs the second opinion reviewer stated, the article currently seems almost too positive. Yet, this is apparently not enough for some members. As of today, there are approximately 178 citations backing up the statements in the article, gleaned from 30 books, 7 separate websites, and 35 separate articles in periodicals. There are more out there. Yet, without the slightest bit of backup, these are all dismissed out of hand on the flimsiest of bases. The accusers purport to know the sources, verification, editorial controls, motivations, etc. which went into those referenced works. They keep holding forth that we must consider the neutrality of sources, and argue the PoV of any source of which they disapprove (which seems to be most everything out there). That just won't play in Peoria. If this nit-picking is characteristic of group members, then I suppose these talk pages stand as a confirmation of some of the most negative assertions made by \"critics.\" Perhaps such tactics work, but they certainly are a big turn-off.\nFinally and somehow, when I or others make concrete observations\u2014''here on the Discussion pages, not in the article itself''\u2014backing up the sources cited in the article, we get accused of WP:OR. But when IP-guy or Mr. Lackman give us the benefit of their un-referenced speculations and observations, we are expected to accept that alone as evidence of verifiable fact. As has been endlessly restated over the last months, Wikipedia is about what sources say, not about what anyone believes, thinks or is willing to accept as \"fact\" based on individual perspective.

One user who has posted using multiple accounts and IP's has shopped his unsupported theories as to all and/or most sources being non-RS and/or SPS to several WP forums, as well as using that rationalization to argue for having this and related articles Afd'd. There have also been assertions that all the sources are subjective opinions and/or that they are sloppy research in which authors parrot a few old and hostile sources. No backup for these tendentious statements have yet been given, just more unsupported aspersions. Similarly, suggestions have been made to forego citing sources and open up the article to unsupported statements. I have long since found it difficult to assume good faith in such tactics, particularly on the part of editors who would \"rather see no article\" and who dispute well-documented and obvious facts based upon hypercritical parsing (i.e., someone, somewhere, somehow may or may not hold or have expressed a different view\u2014extrapolating a supposed or possible exception in an attempt to invalidate a statement of a normative view or practice).\nAs the second opinion reviewer stated, the article currently seems almost too positive. Yet, this is apparently not enough for some members. As of today, there are approximately 178 citations backing up the statements in the article, gleaned from 30 books, 7 separate websites, and 35 separate articles in periodicals. There are more out there. Yet, without the slightest bit of backup, these are all dismissed out of hand on the flimsiest of bases. The accusers purport to know the sources, verification, editorial controls, motivations, etc. which went into those referenced works. They keep holding forth that we must consider the neutrality of sources, and argue the PoV of any source of which they disapprove (which seems to be most everything out there). That just won't play in Peoria. If this nit-picking is characteristic of group members, then I suppose these talk pages stand as a confirmation of some of the most negative assertions made by \"critics.\" Perhaps such tactics work, but they certainly are a big turn-off.\nFinally and somehow, when I or others make concrete observations\u2014''here on the Discussion pages, not in the article itself''\u2014backing up the sources cited in the article, we get accused of WP:OR. But when IP-guy or Mr. Lackman give us the benefit of their un-referenced speculations and observations, we are expected to accept that alone as evidence of verifiable fact. As has been endlessly restated over the last months, Wikipedia is about what sources say, not about what anyone believes, thinks or is willing to accept as \"fact\" based on individual perspective. Have a point to include, find a source. |\n| 6 | John Carter | Also, regarding truth, see WP:TRUTH. Frankly, we can only know what the reliable sources say. If someone wants something true to be added which differs from what the reliable sources say, then the best thing for them to do would be to try to get some other RS to say that. And, regarding the RSN, they aren't infallible, although they are very good in general. But, particularly when dealing with rather obscure sources they haven't encountered before on a subject they don't know, they are as fallible as anyone else. Regarding Jesse Lackman's comments in general, I tend to agree, with the one proviso that it can sometimes be hard to tell what is \"opinion\" when the number of reliable sources, and sources in general, is as scant as it is here. By saying this I am not necessarily criticizing or disagreeing with him or anyone else, just noting that there this is a very difficult subject to find a consensus of reliably sourced statements or conclusions regarding in large part because there is so little information available in the first place. |\n| 7 | 206.130.91.154 | No one wants anything added.  Just cut the crap, especially in the Doctrine section. Significant statements in this section, particularly about Christology, are not from reliable sources. \nAt times I've seen requests in the Talk page to use reliable sources to refute nonsense in the article from non-reliable sources.  Of course, wiki is a joke, everyone knows that, the rats are deserting the sinking ship, as the Wall Street Journal wrote last week, but at the same time wiki still has a lot of influence.  Anyone with actual credentials and knowledge is paid for their work, and that's why such shoddy amateur research gets in here.  This is why I don't use a log in; the multiple IPs cannot be avoided unfortunately.  No way do I want to be associated with this crew. \nThe issue is not one of bias, but of shoddy amateur scholarship. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5sX8Iuwmi9MfxqreddCahCPqlIe", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930137, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3632, "completion_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 3691}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Astynax | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | John Carter | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 7 | 206.130.91.154 | Cold |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

Does anyone have a source, or a map, that can help to confirm this?\"\nI replied, with a reference to Mark Nicholls's article on Catesby in the ''ODNB'' (see above). Nicholls says \"When, early on the morning of 5 November, news spread round London that Guy Fawkes had been captured red-handed in the cellars at Westminster, Catesby and several fellow conspirators fled north, hastening as best they might up Watling Street to the appointed Northamptonshire rendezvous, Percy and John Wright casting their cloaks into the hedgerows in an effort to ride faster.\" Although Nicholls's citation to his source was obscure, being only a PRO accession number, I traced it to the Declaration of Ambrose Rookewood dated 2 December 1605. Parrot of Doom commented (above) \"Thanks, I'll take a look at that and include it in the article once I've done with the Fraser book - unless of course you'd like to make your own additions.\"\nI added a citation myself as follows, under  \"Declaration of Ambrose Rookewood, 2 December 1605 (TNA: PRO SP 14/216/136), cited in Mark Nicholls, 'Catesby, Robert', in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (OUP, 2004)\".\nHere, at 00:20 on 23 November 2009,\nParrot of Doom deleted the citation from the article, with the comment \"fix referencing problem for this para, and delete rookwood confession (will move it to 'further reading')\"\nHere, at 00:22 on 23 November 2009\nParrot of Doom added the citation to the Rookwood Declaration, still with its PRO reference, under a section headed 'Further reading'.\nhere, at 02:10 on 23 November 2009, with the edit summary \"fix\", Parrot of Doom edited that item, deleting all reference to Rookwood's Declaration, including its PRO reference, and converting the item into a bare mention of the existence of an ODNB article on Catesby by Nicholls, the new item reading \"\"\nhere at 01:38 on 26 November 2009\nMalleus Fatuorum removed the amended item completely from 'Further reading' with the comment \"where did this come from?\" I see Malleus Fatuorum's point. The fact that there is an ODNB article on Catesby is neither here nor there for this article, and without any context a mention of it under 'Further Reading' added nothing very useful. The problem here is with Parrot of Doom, who asked for a source, was provided with one, and then moved it out of its context, before changing it until it was worthless, so that another user deleted it.\nAs a lesser instance of this trend, I found a source for a poorly referenced quotation and at this edit I corrected the quotation and cited it to p. 584 of John Nichols's ''The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First'' (1828), including a link to that page online at Google Books.\nAt this edit, at 12:14 on 18 November 2009, Parrot of Doom tidied the citation, deleting the description of the source (\"quoting a letter from Sir Edward Hoby to Sir Thomas Edmonds, Ambassador at Brussels\") and the Google Books link, which I suppose he considered to have no value. However, here, the next day, Parrot added back \"Extract of a letter from Sir Edward Hoby (Gentleman of the Bedchamber) to Sir Thomas Edwards, Ambassador at Brussells\". Without the link to the page, which is still not there, I guess that no one else would have been likely to do it. The general trend to tidy and delete information is clearly a bad one. |\n| 2 | Parrot of Doom | Your second point - the quotation is correctly cited, and nothing has been lost, so I'm not certain what your point is.  Your first point - if you'd read the FAC (and its talk page), you'd have understood why the citation no longer exists.\nI have to say, a simple \"what happened to these two citations\" would have sufficed, rather than the post you've made, which I view as quite unhelpful.  The majority of the citations (and the text, pre-copyedit) in this article exist only because I bothered to spend some money, read every single one of over 500 pages of source material, and spend a good 20-30 hours of my time improving this article.  But obviously two citations are more important than that. |\n| 3 | Moonraker | I do not feel that you have understood the points I made, Parrot of Doom, and I imagine you know that you do not have ownership of the article. My comments were not just about two citations, but about the way you work. It seems your approach is to prefer tidiness (\"correctly cited\") to good information in appropriate citations.\nYou do not seem to have answered the points I made, except aggressively. What is \"the FAC (and its talk page)\", please?

Is Watling St particularly contentious, and does it require a citation?  Maybe.

Please read it, and address it.  Whatever you \"cleaned up\" (I thought an uninvolved third party was supposed to do that - at least that's what you said in the deletion nom - what happened to that?) you still did not fix the following errors in the article:\n1. The Variety review of the movie was positive. (Please see Rotten Tomatoes.) This article reads like the Variety review was (in your words) a semi-uncomplimentary review. Phrases from the review are cherry picked to make it sound bad. (For exmaple, nothing in the review criticized the movies plot at all, yet the article says that it did.)\n2. The article says that the film only received positive reviews during it's festival run. But like was pointed out in the deletion nom, the examples that are currently given weren't during the fest run - at leats, three out of six of them weren't. What say you to that?\n3. The article says there are \"notable exceptions\" to the positive reviews the film got during it's festival run.  But there aren't any listed, and I can't find any.\nAgain, please just tell us the honest truth as to why you won't let simple fixes like that through. It's really looking like you hve something personal at stake here. |\n| 8 | Beyond My Ken | Nope, nothing personal at all.  I have no connection to film, and never heard of it before the sockfarm that was controlling it came to my attention.

One of the things they did was to attempt to bury an semi-uncomplimentary ''Variety'' review deeper into the article, and to substitue higher up less authoritative source. This film is due for home video release soon, and the sockfarm started up again just recently, probably in an attempt to \"fix\" the article to their liking in time for that release.  Now, an IP editor is making similar changes, so I believe that any edits this IP wishes to make should be discussed here first.  This article will not be helped by another attempt to re-shape in a non-POV way. |\n| 2 | 208.88.120.86 | The artile does not appear to be under the control of any sock farm for months; it appears to be under the control of you.  You admitted here that you accidentally introduced contradictory information in the review section of the article during an edit war. The article needs improvement for accuracy and contradictory information; it is C-class and the deletion nom resulted in a consensus that third parties should visit the page (that means ''not you'' - you are too close to it). I recommend you step back. Violating 3RR as you just did, forbiding others from editing your article, etc. unless they talk about it with you, etc. is a violation of WP:OWN. |\n| 3 | 208.88.120.86 | Rather than an ownership dispute, please be specific as to what content I introduced that feel is inaccurate. Your refering to an uncomplimentary Variety review; but i didn't move that review at all. Also it wasnt uncomplimentary; its a positive review  and if anything it looks like you tried to phrase it as if it were a negative review and then got mad whenevr anyone tried to correct you. It looks like theres maybe some bias here so again, please step back. |\n| 4 | Beyond My Ken | The article's been semi-protected by an admin, so if you have any suggestions, you should make them here and they can be discussed. |\n| 5 | DivaOfDan | I have made the following changes to the article for the reasons listed below. Please point out any inaccuracies:\nWikiProject Films says the article needs improvement. I read the deletion nom and I agree it's got inconsistencies. In the nom discussion this was said by the nominater:\n\"Accuracy is in question because there are inconsistencies. Variety review is the most notable review, but the remainder of \"Reception\" section is wierd: \"During the film's earlier festival run it received generally positive reviews.\" But then the reviews listed as having occurred during the \"earlier festival run\" include 3 reviews that it looks like were written during the theatrical run according to the cites. Then it says the film got \"generally positive reviews\" during its festival run \"with certain notable exceptions.\" However, no exceptions are provided. So on second thought maybe there is some COI going on here? I think it needs fresh editors if we're keeping.\" To this,  answered: \"That's a fair point  the reception section was subject to a good amount of back-and-forth editing as the sockpuppets tried to put the film in the best possible light, and other editors, including myself, tried to keep the section as accurate and neutral as possible. This is almost certainly the cause of the discontinuities that you point out. I agree that fresh editors with fresh eyes would be a good idea.\"\nSo Beyond agreed that there were what he called \"inconsistencies\" in the article's data due to \"back-and-forth\" editing that he was involved in. He agreed that a fresh editor (not him) should fix. I point out that when a fresh editor (me) goes in and corrected these contradictions, Beyond 3RRed me by saying that he will not \"allow\" the article to be edited that way. \"Allow\" was the word he used.\nI feel I accurately and honestly in good faith tried to fix the following contradictions:\nThe Varirety review of the movie was positive. (DeBruge is a Top Critic with RT that means he controls how his reviews are posted.) Before I edited it, this article read like the Variety review was (in Beyond My Ken's words) a semi-uncomplimentary review. Phrses from the review were cherry picked to make it sound bad. (For exmaple, Nothing in the review criticized the movies plot at all, yet Beyond My Ken wrote that it did. That was just bad information. I corrected this and wrote, in good faith, what RT and Metacritic said.\nSecond, Beyond had written it so it said that the film only received positive reviews during it's festival run. But like was pointed out in the deletion nom, the examples given weren't during the fest run. Beyond also said there were notable exceptions, but there aren't. So I fixed this.\nThe result was that Beyond swooped in and 3RRed. Again if my facts are wrong please clarify how. Thank you. |\n| 6 | Beyond My Ken | All the comments made in the second AfD were made '''''before''''' I cleaned up the article, so are not relevant now.

So far I've just made a bunch of minor changes because I wanted to discuss the major ones here. According to this handbook (which is considered canon by Marvel), the following changes are going to need to be made:\nXavier's \"Secret Team\" from ''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' are considered regular/main X-Men, not a separate temporary sub-groups like the Muir Island X-Men, Phalanx Invasion X-Men, etc., and they're included in the handbook's chronological list before the ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 \"All-New, All-Different\" team (though I guess their exact chronological placement in our list is debatable based on Wiki rules/norms). '''(Moved to the main list, per the handbook and recent discussion here on the talk page.)'''\nM and Caliban are STILL not included in the main X-Men list, which means they should probably be removed from our main X-Men list. '''(M had already been removed by someone else, but as a compromise with the people who've kept adding her back in the past, I went ahead and added her to the \"Other status\" section. I also removed Caliban from the main list.)'''\nAs I've always thought, Mystique, Lady Mastermind, and Sabretooth are included in the main list, not the infiltrators listthey didn't infiltrate the team while in disguise as someone else like the Phoenix Force, Dark Beast, and the Skrull Wolverine imposter did, but were actual members of the team (albeit with limited or no loyalty, but loyalty isn't the issue here). '''(Done.)'''\nThe \"Manifest Destiny\" and onward status quo is greatly clarified, showing the following:\nAdult/established Marvel characters who join the X-Men become full X-Men if they actively participate in X-Men missions, including all of the \"New Mutants\" squad, Aurora, Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries, Cloak & Dagger, Domino, Danger, Boom-Boom, and Ariel |\n| 2 | DeadpoolRP | Okay, so I've (obviously) started this stuff by creating the X-Men-in-Training and X-Force (X-Men Strike Team) squads. Next up I'll be adding characters to the main X-Men list (the New Mutants, Domino, Danger, Boom-Boom, Ariel, etc.), but I'm still open to thoughts, including regarding Fantomex. A few new questions, though:\n1.) Since the New X-Men and Young X-Men squads have been absorbed into the overarching X-Men-in-Training squad, what should we do about their sections? The New Mutants, Hellions, Paragons, etc., are obviously different, but do we still need separate sections for the more recent two? '''(I'm still unsure about leaving or removing the \"New X-Men\" and \"Young X-Men\" section. Thoughts?)'''\n2.) Since the X-Force and New Mutants are officially X-Men squads, do we need to have the current lineups attached to the end of the later New Mutants and X-Force sections? On this one I definitely say no. '''(Deleted 'em, though someone else bolded current New Mutants in the \"New Mutants\"this seems fine to me as a COMPROMISE, but not as a replacement for having them in the main X-Men list, because they ARE official X-Men members.)''' |\n| 3 | Gillbob316 | Alright, you asked for thoughts, so I'm giving them to you, and they will be long...\nHonestly, I don't like alot of the changes you're making. I like some, but I dislike just as many, if not more. *Shrug*\nIMO, This list isn't the official handbook to the marvel universe, nor does it have to adhere to it so strictly. I liked the way the list was set up much better before you started changing it, for the most part (but again, not completely)...\nSee... it gets hard...\nI like that characters like X-Force, The New Mutants & The Young X-Men are on there... characters who I feel have been around a while, gone on missions, adhered to \"Xavier's Dream\" as it were. Those characters, I feel, have \"earned\" a place on the list... if you get my drift. I support including them. I have no problem believing that these characters would be considered \"X-Men\" by their peers.\nI hate however, including people like Lady Mastermind & Mystique, who were never sincerely members, just spies, Sabretooth, who was never even willingly a member, Petra & Sway, who were just BS retconned into being members before characters we've been reading for 40+ years now, and died just as quickly, The Science Squad, a bunch of lab-coats who don't really go on missions, and are there more for research opportunities than to be X-Men, and who just kind-of hang out around the real members, and the 100 mutants who came from fleeting stories like X-Corp, Manifest Destiny & Exodus, that introduce characters like Stringfellow, Darkstar, Fantomex & Ariel to the team fleetingly, and give people the impression that they're full-fledged X-Men, even though they barely assist the team for one mission and then disapear... it's asinine.\nI mean, ideally, I'd like for this list to be approached with a certain element of common sense.

I don't feel they belong there, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. (Though I don't quite know where to put them otherwise. Possibly in Utopia recruits?) [Possibly Aurora also, though I'm undecided on her, since she came in during Secret Invasion, before Nation X].\nI still don't like Lady Mastermind, Mystique & Sabretooth on the main list, and would support moving them back to imposters/infiltrators/involuntary.

Regardless of where Marvel places them in the handbook, none of them were ever really part of the team. And while they may not have been imposters, they WERE undeniably infiltrators. It's not like I'm saying \"ban all villains from the main list\". I have no problem with Magneto, Juggernaut or Emma for instance, since they were all villains making a sincere effort to reform. Even Juggernaut who |\n| 5 | DeadpoolRP | Gillbob316: Thanks for all of your feedback, comments, compliments, and constructive criticismI'm definitely considering everything you said before making changes, and I'll try to address all of the main points that have been discussed. Between you, me, and Tomahawk1221 (the people who've posted their thoughts so far on these issues), here's where we seem to stand:\nTwo people are FOR moving the current X-Force squad up into the X-Men section (per the handbook) and one is AGAINST it.\nTwo people are FOR moving the Deadly Genesis team onto the main list (per the handbook) and one is AGAINST it.\nTwo people are FOR moving Mystique, Lady Mastermind, and Sabretooth onto the main list (per the handbook) and one is AGAINST it.\nTwo people are FOR moving the New Mutants squad onto the main list (per the handbook) and one didn't say either way.\nSo to me, at least, the problem we have here is apparent and logical: While everyone would like to think that their opinion is common sense and logical, there are always going to be disagreements in situations like these, so we really can't just decide to use common sense. Which is why I feel that, in situations like these, we really do just need to defer to the official decision from Marvelthey own the characters and they decide who's a member of what group. If they change their minds down the road, then by all means, make the changes then. But we're already going to have enough trouble interpreting the current \"everyone's a mutant\" status quo as future issues come outwe might as well use the resource Marvel has given us as far as membership in already-published issues goes.

From the start the Byzantine imperial mythomoteur was dual, at once dynastic and religious. As vice-regent of God and heir of the universal Roman Empire, the Byzantine emperor was more than another dynastic ruler, he carried the nostalgia of the classical work! and the messianic hopes of Orthodox Christianity into battle on behalf of the community of the faithful. But that community became more and more Greek in speech and outlook. Though Latin long held sway in Court and bureaucratic circles, the cultural cement of the empire\u2019s core populations was Greek and its education was in the Greek classics and tongue.\nImperial tradition, Christian Orthodoxy and Greek culture became even more the bases of Byzantium and her Hellenic community, after she had lost most of her western and Asiatic possessions in the seventh century \u2014 to Visigoths and then Arabs m Spain and North Africa, to the Lombards in much of Italy, to the Slavs in the Balkans and to Muslim armies in Egypt and the Near East. Political circumstances, and the resilience of Greek culture and Greek education, made her predominantly Greek in speech and character. After the sack of Constantinople in 1204 and the establishment of a Latin empire under Venetian auspices, the rivalry of the Greek empires based on Nicaca, Epirus and Trebizond to realize the patriotic Hellcmc dream of recapturing the former capital further stimulated Greek ethnic sentiment against Latin usurpation. W1cn in the face of Turkith threats, the fifteenth-century Byzantine emperor, Michael Palaeologus, tried to place the Orthodox Church under the Papacy and hence Western protection; an inflamed Greek sentiment vigorously opposed his policy. The city\u2019s populace in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, their Hellenic sentiments fanned by monks, priests and the Orthodox party against the Latin policies of the government, actually preferred the Turkish turban to the Latin mitre and attacked the urban wealthy classes.\nBut the Turkish conquest and the demise of Byzantium did not spell the end of the Orthodox Greek community and its ethnic sentiment. tinder its Church and Patriarch, and organized as a recognized milliet of the Ottoman empire, the Greek community flourished in exile, the upper classes of its Diaspora assuming privileged economic and bureaucratic positions in the empire. So Byzantine bureaucratic incorporation had paradoxical effects: as in Egypt, it helped to sunder the mass of the Greek community from the state and its Court and bureaucratic imperial myths and culture in favour of a more demotic Greek Orthodoxy; but, unlike Egypt, the demise of the state served to strengthen that Orthodoxy and reattach to it the old dynastic Messianic symbolism of a restored Byzantine empire in opposition to Turkish oppression. |\n| 2 | Anothroskon | '''Smith, Anthony Robert (1991).

The ethnic origins of nations. Oxford: B. Blackwell. pp. 108. ISBN 0-631-16169-4.''' |\n| 4 | Anothroskon | The importance of these and other factors can also be seen when we turn to the closely related questions of how ethnies change in character, dissolve or survive. Let me start with ethnic change and with a well-known example, that of the Greeks. Modern Greeks are taught that they are the heirs and descendants not merely of Greek Byzantium, but also of the ancient Greeks and their classical Hellenic civilization. In both cases (and there have in fact been two, rival, myths of descent at work since the early nineteenth century), \u2018descent\u2019 was seen in largely demographic terms; or rather, cultural affinity with Byzantium and ancient Greece (notably Athens) was predicated on demographic continuity. Unfortunately for the classicist Hellenic myth, the demographic evidence is at best tenuous, at worst non-existent. As Jacob Fallmereyer demonstrated long ago, Greek demographic continuity was brutally interrupted in the late sixth to eighth centuries AD by massive influxes of Avar, Slav and, later, Albanian immigrants. The evidence from the period suggests that the immigrants succeeded in occupying most of central Greece and the Peloponnesus (Morea), pushing the original Greek-speaking and Hellenic inhabitants (themselves already intermingled with earlier Macedonian, Roman and other migrants) to the coastal areas and the islands of the Aegean. This shifted the centre of a truly Hellenic civilization to the east, to the Aegean, the Ionian littoral of Asia Minor and to Constantinople. It also meant that modem Greeks could hardly count as being of ancient Greek descent, even if this could never be ruled out.\u2019 There is a sense in which the preceding discussion is both relevant to a sense of Greek identity, now and earlier, and irrelevant. It is relevant in so far as Greeks, now and earlier, fellt that their \u2018Greekness\u2019 was a product of their descent from the ancient Greeks (or Byzantine Greeks), and that such filiations made them feel themselves to be members of one great \u2018super-family\u2019 of Greeks, shared sentiments of continuity and membership being essential to a lively sense of identity. It is irrelevant in that ethnies arc constituted, not by lines of physical descent, but by the sense of continuity, shared memory and collective destiny, i.e. by lines of cultural affinity embodied in distinctive myths, memories, symbols and values retained by a given cultural unit of population. In that sense much has been retained, and revived, from the extant heritage of ancient Greece. For, even at the time of Slavic migrations, in Ionia and especially in Constantinople, there was a growing emphasis on the Greek language, on Greek philosophy and literature, and on classical models of thought and scholarship. Such a \u2018Greek revival\u2019 was to surface again in the tenth and fourteenth centuries, as well as subsequently, providing a powerful impetus to the sense of cultural affinity with ancient Greece and its classical heritage. This is not to deny for one moment either the enormous cultural changes undergone by the Greeks despite a surviving sense of common ethnicity or the cultural influence of surrounding peoples and civilizations over two thousand years. At the same time in terms of script and language, certain values, a particular environment and its nostalgia, continuous social interactions, and a sense of religious and cultural difference, even exclusion, a sense of Greek identity and common sentiments of ethnicity can be said to have persisted beneath the many social and political changes of the last two thousand years |\n| 5 | Anothroskon | Seems to me the king of modern anthropology is a Greek nationalist.

I'm not trying to start another argument about what counts, but it seems wrong to limit out those other screamo bands from this article, especially if we're making a big deal that those bands that aren't considered emo by purists be called emo in this article. Shouldn't the purists get the same respect in regards to what they believe is screamo, especially when the wiki article about screamo is about the original type? ~Zombies!!! |\n| 2 | ChrisB | The screamo article notes that the term is currently being used to describe something other than the original screamo, which is exactly what this article says.\nBut, contrary to your assertion, there is no widely-accepted old-school screamo scene at this moment, just bands here and there emulating the style.  The original screamo scene was known nationally, the bands playing old-school screamo now are not.  The word \"screamo\" is in far greater use now to describe bands like Thrice and Glassjaw, and majority rules, regardless of how \"right\" or \"wrong\" it is.  Wiki is here to describe reality, not the wishes of the minority.\nYour argument is identical to those who wish for \"emo\" to solely describe the 80s DC version.  There are currently a handful of bands out there still playing that style of music.  But I would readily venture that none of them call themselves \"emo\" now that the term is more popularly used to describe something else.\nIf you want to beef-up the screamo article and talk about some of the modern bands emulating the old screamo sound, have at it. |\n| 3 | Zombies!!! | This article says \" The term screamo, however, was used to describe an entirely different genre in the early 1990s,\" when in reality screamo is still being used to describe new bands of this same sound. You're right, the majority thinks that Thursday et al, are screamo, and I'm not disputing this fact.\nwhat i'm trying to get at is that in the discussion for this article it seems that an agreement was reached that all three types of emo (hardcore, indie, new) would be represented in this article, something that I'm willing to agree with. However, this agreement should apply to screamo, especially since the wiki article on screamo talks about the original genre and not the new interpretation of it.\nif anything, what you're saying about majority rule contradicts itself as if one was to click on the screamo link they would be reading about something that was completely different than what they think screamo is.\nI'm only saying that we should point out that the word screamo has the same type of debate surrounding it as the word emo. It only serves to show how there is a difference between the mainstream interpretation and the underground one. I'm not trying to force my definition onto the article, that's why I posted before editing. I always thought the point of wikipedia was education, and people need to know that just like how there are many definitions of emo, as outlined in this article, that there are multiple defs of screamo. We just need to add another sentence and this article is pretty much fine by my standards~ Zombies!!! |\n| 4 | ChrisB | Okay, fine, but I hope you realize the can of worms this is opening.  Because of this, we're going to have to update the screamo article to more accurately reflect the term's current usage, and I'm already anticipating the screaming pinhead thirtysomethings whinging about how \"THAT'S NOT SCREAMO\" and wiping it out.  In other words: don't disappear.  I'm expecting you to go to bat for this when it happens.  (\"Education\" goes both ways, mind you.) |\n| 5 | Zombies!!! | That might be a mess. especially since I would agree with them and not you. I guess it doesn't really bother me if this article stays the way it is. I think having a section about this here in the discussion area is good enough.

But I would readily venture that none of them call themselves \"emo\" now that the term is more popularly used to describe something else.\nIf you want to beef-up the screamo article and talk about some of the modern bands emulating the old screamo sound, have at it.  \nThis article says \" The term screamo, however, was used to describe an entirely different genre in the early 1990s,\" when in reality screamo is still being used to describe new bands of this same sound. You're right, the majority thinks that Thursday et al, are screamo, and I'm not disputing this fact.\nwhat i'm trying to get at is that in the discussion for this article it seems that an agreement was reached that all three types of emo (hardcore, indie, new) would be represented in this article, something that I'm willing to agree with. However, this agreement should apply to screamo, especially since the wiki article on screamo talks about the original genre and not the new interpretation of it.\nif anything, what you're saying about majority rule contradicts itself as if one was to click on the screamo link they would be reading about something that was completely different than what they think screamo is.\nI'm only saying that we should point out that the word screamo has the same type of debate surrounding it as the word emo. It only serves to show how there is a difference between the mainstream interpretation and the underground one. I'm not trying to force my definition onto the article, that's why I posted before editing. I always thought the point of wikipedia was education, and people need to know that just like how there are many definitions of emo, as outlined in this article, that there are multiple defs of screamo. We just need to add another sentence and this article is pretty much fine by my standards~ Zombies!!! |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5ti1vWAPO6oDQRmKwnampQDdIyd", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930210, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3254, "completion_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 3303}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | Timeasimperialism | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 7 | RexNL | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

My opinion is that it shouldn't go in the article at all because the theory doesn't hold up.\nMost of the discussion is sourced from Jessica Hopper's article in Punk Planet from three years ago.  The article completely fails to make the case, as it doesn't cite specific songs or lyrics as sexist.  Her case is that it's sexist because a whole ton of bands have generic songs about how they've been wronged in a relationship.  Because it's almost entirely guys singing about what (to her) are generic women, taken as a whole, it's sexist.  Which is a flawed argument, given the lack of specifics and the absurd generalizations she makes.\nShe makes the case that bands like Jawbox, SDRE, and Jawbreaker used to sing similar songs, but they were about ''specific'' women, so they were okay.  That argument fails completely.  If Jawbreaker released ''Dear You'' today, by her argument, a song like \"Bad Scene, Everyone's Fault\" would meet her exact argument as a generic breakup song written from the point of view of a male.  It's not about anyone specific.  Yet she gives them a pass.\nHow does she know that those bands' songs were about specific women?  By and large, those songs didn't name names.  She's making an assumption that doesn't hold up to journalistic integrity - she ''believes'' that they're about specific women, but has absolutely no proof that it's the case.\nShe's appalled because women go to emo shows and sing along to songs that to her sound sexist.  It's the \"they don't know any better\" argument.  Maybe to those women, those songs have meaning and are about someone specific - the same generalization that Hopper made about those Jawbox, SDRE, and Jawbreaker songs.\n\"The ones who are young, for whom this is likely their inaugural introduction to the underground, who\u2019s gateway may have been through Weezer or the Vagrant America tour or maybe Dashboard Confessional\u2019s Unplugged sesh on the MTV.\"  And what's the difference between that and girls who know all the lyrics to the latest teen pop thing?  I'd like for them to listen to better music, too, but that doesn't support her argument - it just explains why she's making |\n| 2 | Cedars | Taking a more general view of the comment presented, I do feel the criticism of emo section is a weak point of the article and that improvements to it should be welcomed. I am still uncomfortable with the inclusion of the emogame. I believe it overemphasizes the significance of the game (which is now not mentioned by the other emo article) and while I accepted Chris' comment above, the fact that there is no authoritive reference for the emogame content means I would still like to see it removed from the article. |\n| 3 | ChrisB | 3) To what degree does criticism of emo affect the rest of the genre?  I've seen people criticize albums like Sunny Day Real Estate's ''Diary'' simply because they're associated with \"emo\", even though those albums don't even remotely resemble the \"emo\" that they complain about.  Which addresses:\nAnd you feel the emogame reflects a broad criticism of the emo genre so much so that it deserves literally 37% of the criticism section (even if there is not a single cited source for it)?\nAGAIN: WHAT KIND OF CITED SOURCE ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?  What are you expecting the cited source to say?\nSeveral of the following are simply excerpts, but it can be readily confirmed that the entire articles exist:\nAlternative Press\nSPIN\nMagnet\nNew York Times\nRolling Stone\nIn particular, you can purchase the entire NYT article from their website.  The Rolling Stone one should also be on their website.  There are more out there, but it's not worth my time to go hunt them down.\n4) Do people really know what they're criticizing?  Okay, so they hate emo dress and hate Hawthorne Heights.  They level charges like the unfounded crap that Protozoic Waste was trying to squeeze into the article.  Is that relevant to Emo music?  Or are they stereotyping everything that looks emo into one \"emo\" package?  And if they don't know what they're talking about, just making criticisms, why should we dignify it by including it here?\nThe problem is not that the article doesn't include everything or does not include everything every casual observer thinks about emo. The problem is this article has problems that are evident to people who know nothing about the genre. It's good to keep a level of control especially on articles as vandalism-prone as this but even without the vandalism problems this isn't a near-feature quality article - change should be invited not discouraged. Some superficial problems include the two sentence paragraph that initiates the article and the heading that breaks up the third wave section.\nWidespread criticism of \"emo\" stereotypes DOES NOT BELONG HERE.  Again, this isn't the article about \"Emo the trend\".  Any criticism included here should address the bands that are actually (willingly) considered emo, not the ones that people are trying to cram in as \"emo\".\nAgreed but the criticism section needs work. Even if you feel a mention of the emogame is worth it why do we need to know that the game \"included pop culture references such as R2-D2 from Star Wars\" and |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5tpd8JZDVK1bDt3cA3oWZQ1ypLh", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930217, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3810, "completion_tokens": 56, "total_tokens": 3866}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ChrisB | Assured-Dominant |\n| 2 | Cedars | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | ChrisB | Assured-Dominant |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

I realize that there are flaws in the piece you're referring to, but that can be made about any criticism of just about anything. I highly doubt the AP survey was scientific and therefore it's not journalistic either. Even with the arguments you made against the article in PP, I still feel that Emo is sexist because 1) it reflects the sexist leanings of rock and roll 2)for the reasons the article point out (minus the argument that emo is poorly written because I do like some of the newer bands even though they're nowhere near \"true\" emo.) I just think posting that some people believe that emo is sexist because it focuses on breaks up that often times demonize women might be in order. I'm definately all about you posting a counterargument attacking the warrants of the PP article to make it more neutral and let people decide for themselves if emo is or is not sexist. |\n| 5 | ChrisB | You entirely missed my point.  \"Emo music\" isn't necessarily the same thing as music that's labelled \"emo\".  Some people said that Stone Temple Pilots were a grunge band.  It doesn't automatically mean that they ''were'' a grunge band.  (More often than not, they're simply labelled \"alternative rock\", which is probably the most appropriate designation for reasons I won't get into.) |\n| 6 | ChrisB | The problem with my MCR note was that on further review, I can't guarantee that the band wrote the intro.  I checked out the CDBaby entries of people that I'm personally familiar with, and the intros say things that I can't fathom those people actually saying about themselves.  I'm starting to suspect that CDBaby's editors write the intros, while the bands write the descriptions. |\n| 7 | Cedars | What worries me is that you seem so focused on protecting this article you can't see past its flaws.

You can both receive a ban for that btw. As an outsider (neither Croatian nor Italian) it seems to me that the facts are that Giulio Clovio was born in Gri\u017eane, Croatia. According to one source I found on Google Books he moved to Italy when he was 18. He is referred to as an \"Italian painter\" in many older sources and it is common to find this in the literature.\nFor a modern reference to Clovio being referred to as Croatian: \"Ante Split also notes that a contemporary, Bernardo Guidoni, called him \u201cGiulio Clovio from Croatia\u201d (a Crovatia) and his gravestone labeled him also as being from Croatia, Julio Clovis de Croatia.\" from John Van Antwerp Fine, When ethnicity did not matter in the Balkans, University of Michigan Press, 2006 .\nMy suggestion would be to rewrite the lede to include such information. He was a Croatian born painter, who moved to Italy and spent most of his professional career in Italy. Because of where he did his work he is often referred to as an Italian painter.\nRe his name: I would suggest keeping the name as Giulio Clovio. A quick search of say Google scholar on Giulio Clovio results in a little more than 900 hits, while a search on (Juraj) Julije Klovi\u0107 gives about 100 or so. So retaining the Italian version makes more sense. The other spelling (Juraj Julije Klovi\u0107) should be mentioned. |\n| 2 | Philosopher12 | I agree. I am sorry for editing (\nI would add he spent time in Italy and Hungary, since his most important works were in Budapest also. So \"as an illuminator and painter who was born in Croatia, but who was active in Italy and Hungary.\" if you all agree. |\n| 3 | AnnekeBart | \"active in Italy and Hungary\" sounds fine to me -). Is there a source for that though? I'm not questioning you, but I think that a reliable source would be good given the discussions up to this point. |\n| 4 | Philosopher12 | No problem, I'll post it here later today so we can discuss it.  \n'''Hi.'''\n All Clovio scholars, both his admirers and his detractors, recognize that he was Italian.\n All the encyclopedias of the world\n\" This is the only encyclopedia that writes that Clovio was a croatian. \"\nThe voice is POV. '''Absolutely'''.  \n Please add comments to the bottom of the discussion for clarity. The only one doing POV pushing seems to be you. Several sources have now been shown that clearly state that he was born in Croatia. Including several you added btw.\n ''Old Master Paintings and Drawings.'' Di Roy Bolton. clearly states he is of Croatian descent. The encyclopedias you mention ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art.'', ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists.'' both clearly state he is born in Croatia. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.'' even mentions \"Macedonian descent\" (whatever that means). And the problem is that these online encyclopedias are usually not considered Reliable Sources. Similarly  is some online text of unknown background.\n Furthermore I would add that you are in violation of the 3 revert rule (WP:3RR), you are now going against consensus WP:Consensus, and there are continued problems I see with Reliable Sources (WP:RS).\n To argue your point you would need a Secondary Source (WP:SECONDARY) which would be a reliable book or journal article that states Clovio is considered Italian. Online encyclopedias and webpages do not cut it. Looking at Google Books and Scholar would be the place to find it. Or even better a citation from an article obtained through JSTOR or other academic source. So far the pages you have provided do not support your case.  \n\" Errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum \" Davide41 (talk)\n -) I suggest you take your own \"advice\" |\n| 5 | Davide41 | The voice is POV.

W. Bradley\u2019s book, it is quite clear that he compiled Clovio\u2019s biographical data from Kukuljevic\u2019s book\n page 369\nA lithograph of good execution in \"Slovnik umjetnikah jugoslavenskih od Ivana Kukuljevica Sakcinskoga,\" i.e. \"Lexicon of South-Slavonic Biography, by Ivan Kukuljevic Sakcinski.\" Art. Klovio, p. 160. Under the portrait is Julio Klovio, sitnoslikar. (Julio Clovio, miniature-painter.)\nIf you go to the Kukuljevic\u2019s book: Slovnik umjetnikah jugoslavenskih od Ivana Kukuljevica Sakcinskoga, u Zagrebu 1858 Tiskom narodne tiskarne dra Ljudevita Gaja\nyou\u2019ll see this text (p 156-157)\nKlovio Juraj Julio, najslavniji sitnoslikar. Rodio se g 1498 u Grizanah, neznatnom selu hrvatskoga Primorja, u kotaru vinodolskom. Sto mu biahu roditelji i kako se zvahu to se zaliboze ne zna. Neima sumnje da je njegovo prezime stoprv u Italiji, po obicaju onoga vremena, preinaceno i potalijanceno. U cielom hrvatskom Primorju neima ni jednoga pismenoga spomenika u kom bi se spominjalo ime porodice Klovia. Naprotiv dolaze u pismih onoga vremena: \"Glovicic\" i \"Glavicic\" u Grizanah i u Novom, \"Glovon\" i \"Glavan\" u Trsat, \u201cGobic\u201d u Grizanah, \u201cGlavic\u201d u Bosni a poslije u Dalmaciji i u hrvatskome Primorju.\nThe only known and widely used contemporary biography of this Italian painter came from  the Vasari\u2019s book: The lives of the painters, sculptors & architects, \nIn the Clovio\u2019s biography Vasari wrote: \u201c...although his elders, of the family of the Clovi, had come from Macedonia; and the name given to him at baptism was Giorgio Giulio\u201d from where it is clear\na)\tClovio\u2019s ethnicity is unknown for Macedonia\u2019s origin could imply Greek or Slav ethnicity\nb)\tClovio\u2019s name at baptism was Giorgio Giulio\nContrary to the only valid source, \u2018illuminated\u2019 Sakcinski contemplated\na)\tClovio\u2019s name was changed and italianized (Neima sumnje da je njegovo prezime stoprv u Italiji, po obicaju onoga vremena, preinaceno i potalijanceno). As a proof, Sakcinski offers that there is no a single document (pismenoga spomenika)  mentioning Clovio\u2019s (Klovio) family name\nb)\tHe counts some Slavic names (above \u201cGlovicic\u201d, \u201cGlavicic\u201d, etc), in Bosnia and Dalmatia,  as a possible \u2018solution\u2019 i.e. non-italianized Clovio |\n| 2 | AnnekeBart | I looked it up and Vasari states: ''\" He was born at Grisone in the diocese of Madrucci in Sclavonia or Croatia although his ancestors came from Macedonia and his baptismal name was Giulio Clovio\"''\n and just a bit further down the page it says ''\" At eighteen he came to Italy\"'' See Vasari, The lives of the painters, sculptors & architects, Volume 8 page 205. Google Books\n The Croatian background is firmly established by Vasari. It is further mentioned in several other reliable sources:\n * John Van Antwerp Fine, When ethnicity did not matter in the Balkans, University of Michigan Press, 2006\n * Elena Calvillo, Romanit\u00e0 and Grazia: Giulio Clovio's Pauline Frontispieces for Marino Grimani, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 82, No. 2 (Jun., 2000), pp. 280-297 ETC\n You have so far misquoted/misrepresented Vasari, or else selectively used those fragments of text that can be twisted to support you claims.\n You have already been warned on your talk page that your Italian nationalist editing could result in a ban.\n There is no \"Croatization\" here. It is merely reporting what is in the literature. |\n| 3 | Luciano di Martino | Looks like that you have, at least, two problems beside utter lack of any academic background in the medieval history of Italy. The first one that might be is poor understanding the English text you tried to refer to (your quote of Vasari). The second possible one, you did not read the reference you tried to use in proving the apparent nonsense (Clovio being a Croat). Van Antwerp Fine, as a serious historian, states clearly on 195th page of his book: ''Whether Croatia was just an identifying mark, separating him from many other Juliuses in Italy, or whether he took his place of origin as a serious or ethnic-type identity, cannot be determined from the signature alone.'' In addition to, I am not an Italian nationalist, rather a university professor of medieval history at a notable American university.

My English is just fine. Thank you for inquiring. Considering your irrational responses I seriously doubt your claims to being a historian. Seriously misquoting Vasari as you did is not something a real professor would do, and neither is quoting from encyclopedias and then not knowing what a tertiary source is. So stop the false posturing. |\n| 5 | 94.253.175.158 | WOW, how many notable university professors are here on wikipedia, first Davide, then Luciano. I feel privileged now being in company of such notable people. I always wanted to meet Jacques Le Goff, is he also here?\nWhat we surely have: 1.) According to Vasari, whom i quoted:\n\"\"Nacque egli nell'anno 1498 a Grizane in Croazia, villagio presso l'Adriatico al sud di Fiume, in un distretto allora appartenente ai Frangiapane. Il suo nome nella lingua nativa fu Iurai Glovischsich, cioe Giorgio Clovio, come ei italianamente lo transformo; suo padre fu macedone e sua madre illirica. Della sua infanzia non vi sono notizie; e probabile ch'ei vivesse in patria presso i parenti, e studiasse disegno in qualche convento di quei luoghi. Si puo pur credere che date le continue guerre l'ammiraglio Grimani passasse piu volte per la Croazia, e che in uno di questi suoi viaggi conoscesse il giovane Clovio e lo conducese con se a Venezia.\"\n2.) He called himself Croata, and \"Macedo\" (for unknown reasons, maybe to suggest that his predecessor was Alexander the Great).\nBut for those claiming contrary, for the Xth time, you don't have anything to prove he was Italian except tertiary sources (encyclopaedias, dictionaries). Did he call himself \"Giulio Clovio Italiano\"? No, he called himself Macedo or Croata. Was he born in Italy? No, he was born in Croatia. Are words on his tomb \"Giulio Clovio Italiano\" or \"Giulio Clovio from Italy\"? No, it says \"Iulius Clovius de Croatia\". Since he was in Italy for most of his life, in such tertiary sources is always stated that he was Italian. |\n| 6 | Luciano di Martino | '''Warning''' This student  slipped into open lying by attributing the quoted text to Vasari falsely.  rants the same nonsense over and over. Vasari was not concerned about (Croatian) ethnic background of Clovio. As to my academic background and status and my employer, please, find a serious lawyer, deposit 10 000 USD, I'll double the proposed sum and let loser(s) pay(s) the lawyer and the winner(s) take(s) all. (Proposal to both of them) |\n| 7 | AnnekeBart | Charming, more insults. If Vasari was not concerned with nationality, then why did you bring him up? And if you are not here solely for nationalist reasons then why are most if not all of your edits concerned with this issue? Why are you not adding real content? Nothing to offer? I refuse to further deal with this nonsense.

Then as now there were many more small machines than big ones. It was the capacity of large machines that drove the K/M usage. When IBM announced the 360 in 1964, they spoke of ''core storage memory'' up to 8,000,000 characters see . In 1969 the 360/65 at MIT's computation center had 256 or 512 K of core memory. Semiconductor memory had nothing to do with it. And even semiconductor memory was not consistent in usage. I have some 64K memory chips whose part numbers use \"65\" to indicate size. This is in the early 80s. |\n| 6 | Tom94022 | It may not.  I think in an edit now archived you made the point that IBM was very careful in its documentation and didn't use the terms K or M in any sense, preferring either to state an exact decimal number to whatever digits necessary or using thousand and/or million.  I think that's true.  So when and what led to first the \"common\" use of \"K\" in a binary sense and then \"M\"?  As near as I can tell it was not \"common\" until sometime in the 1970s certainly a long time after \"introduction of main memory larger than 32,768 addressable units\" - that is long after 1964.  BTW I looked at the original PDP8 manual, mainly used 4,096 with a few 4Ks.  Intel didn't use \"K\" on the 1103.  When did it become \"common\"?

Nonetheless, it is exceedingly common within the computing industry when denoting binary capacity\u2014particularly in marketing literature and product packaging\u2014to use uppercase K and no space (1KB), although \u201c1\u00a0KB\u201d is not incorrect and is often considered more suitable in technical writing. became common in the late 1960s and early 1970s particularly with introduction of semiconductor memory  As memory sizes grew the computer industry adopted the prefixes \u201cM\u201d for mega and \u201cG\u201d for giga denoting 1,073,741,824 and 1,099,511,627,776 bytes of memory respectively. |\n| 2 | ArnoldReinhold | The use of uppercase K to denote 1000 was common in the electronics industry before computers were invented. Look at any schematic diagram from the period. Standardizing on lowercase k was initiated by the introduction of SI in 1960 to avoid confusing with the symbol for Kelvin. SI was adopted by NBS in the US in 1964 (NBS Administrative Bulletin 64-6 issued Feb 1964, per NASA SP-7012) and took many years to gain wide acceptance. Same for the space between number and unit. One publisher I work with insists on no space. In any case, this issue does not belong in an article on hard disk drives. Also people using K for memory, as in 16K or 32K, were mostly using it as an approximation, as was common in the electronics industry for other values, such as resistance or voltage. The distinction begins to get serious at 64K (or is it 65K, both were used).  It became very important for the System/360 architecture with its 24 bit address space. (128K vs 131K, 256K vs 262K, etc.) Amdahl may have been the first to make the 1K=1024 statement explicit. And all this precedes solid state memory. I would suggest the following wording (note corrected values for M and G):\nLikewise, the practice of using prefixes assigned to ''powers of 1024'' within the industry also traces its roots to the early days of computing Using the prefix \u201cK\u201d to denote 1024 became common in the late 1960s and early 1970s particularly with introduction of main memory larger than 32,768 addressable units.  As main memory sizes grew, the computer industry adopted the prefixes \u201cM\u201d for mega and \u201cG\u201d for giga denoting 1,048,536 and 1,073,741,824 bytes of main memory respectively. |\n| 3 | Tom94022 | Hi Arnold:  I have no problem with dropping footnote 2 regarding k vs K as TMI; I'd already cut it back from the original edit by GregL. I am less certain about changing the second sentence from semiconductor advent to main memory size as the driver to making K meaning 1024 common.  Perhaps both.  And perhaps the threshold should be 64 KiB since it absent a qualifier such as in the Amdahl article it is simply not clear whether by K an author meant nK = n * 1034 or nK ~ n * 1000. |\n| 4 | Tom94022 | I took a look a Phister, Data Processing Technology and Economics - he shows the average memory size on both IBM and other computers in 1969 as 60 kB (decimal) so that occurs long before semiconductor usage.  This suggests semiconductor is at least as important as memory size.  Or maybe both are just coincidence.  We may be getting close to OR here as is indeed the original sentence. |\n| 5 | ArnoldReinhold | I don't think average memory size has any relevance here. Then as now there were many more small machines than big ones. It was the capacity of large machines that drove the K/M usage. When IBM announced the 360 in 1964, they spoke of ''core storage memory'' up to 8,000,000 characters see . In 1969 the 360/65 at MIT's computation center had 256 or 512 K of core memory. Semiconductor memory had nothing to do with it. And even semiconductor memory was not consistent in usage. I have some 64K memory chips whose part numbers use \"65\" to indicate size.

Before headlamp lenses were made out of thick glass that reminded me of wiki_link cooking vessels intended for use inside an oven. Is it true that it was in fact heat-resistant borosilicate glass? What is the plastic in use nowadays? I suppose it is wiki_link plastic, but is it regular or somehow treated/coated? I would want answers to these questions in the article. Also, were the transition to plastic lenses possible only after halogen lamps became history? I believe that halogen lamps emitted so much heat that polycarbonate would have melted. So, if the transition was only possible because of technological development in lamps, and a consequence of this (better efficiency, less heat), please point it out in the article. Also, I suppose the use of plastic resulted in weight savings, but is there some drawbacks in plastic? I found some info about high heat polycarbonate. [EXTERNA_LINK: http://www.omnexus.com/sds/headlight-appearance-performance/index.aspx] |\n| 2 | Wtshymanski | This  says that US makers started using plastic headlamps in the 1980's to save weight. The polycarbonate plastic is less dense than glass, adn the whole reflector/lens assembly can be made with fewer metal parts, further reducing weight. Google Books says Popular Mechanics was writing about plastic lenss in cars in 1991 (comparing their high replacement cost with the cheap sealed beam bulbs). I don't think old-time glass lenses were anything special but maybe I can find a reference as to the kind of glass used; recall that an old-time \"sealed beam\" used to sell for a coupe of bucks, so I doubt the glass was anything otehr than good old soda-lime ( or maybe with some lead oxide?). So, I don't think it was tied to halogen lamps as much as to the push to save weight in the days of ever-decreasing CAFE standards. Original research: my 1973 Meteor, 1981 K-Car and 1986 VW Jetta all had glass headlamp lenses (and every one of them had a hole in a lens and a burnt bulb as a result), my '94 Passat had plastic (I think...don't recall), and my curent 7-year-old car has plastic lenses, which have yet to develop a hole (but which are getting yellow). |\n| 3 | Scheinwerfermann | \"Plastic\" headlamp lenses are indeed made of polycarbonate with a coating applied to the front face to protect the polycarbonate from damage by abrasion and UV exposure. In the US, the polycarbonate material and coating combination must be on the external_link of materials that are manufacturer-certified as having passed the tests specified in external_link; these include a 3-year outdoor exposure period in Arizona (sunny and dry) and the same in Florida (sunny and humid) after which no more than 30% haze is permitted. Outside the US, the wiki_link on headlamps contain requirements for plastic materials. They're broadly similar (polycarbonate material with coating) but they use an accelerated test with an electric source of UV light (an unshielded arc lamp) rather than putting the material samples out in the sun for a few years. Aside from some early experiments at GE with polycarbonate-lens sealed beams, the first plastic headlamp lenses in the US came out for 1984 on Ford's new-that-year composite replaceable-bulb headlamps. The choice of plastic rather than glass was entirely cost-based. European (rest of the world) regulations did not permit plastic lenses until 1993. The plastic materials are more versatile with respect to styling; more complicated shapes can more easily be moulded. And the plastic lenses weigh less, and are more compatible with European pedestrian-protection regulations governing maximum impact force on pedestrian legs, knees, etc.\n:::Glass headlamp lenses were and are made of either soda-lime \"soft\" glass or borosilicate \"hard\" glass, depending on the specific headlamp design and manufacturer. Sometimes lenses are further treated (tempered/toughened) for heavy-duty service as required by the intended application.\n:::Which one's better, plastic or glass? Neither, overall; each has its merits and drawbacks. Glass is breakable, but plastic cooks in the sun and can't effectively be polished (you wind up polishing the hard coat off the lens, then the degradation comes back faster and worse). Replaceable lenses aren't as common as they once were even outside North America because the complex shapes of today's styled headlamps make it very difficult to obtain a good and durable seal without gluing the lens to the housing. Within North America replaceable lenses have always been permitted but never been common because headlamps so equipped are subject to more stringent requirements for reflector durability and repeatable seal integrity, which means higher cost to manufacture.\n:::When I get a chance, I will try and add some or all of this material, appropriately sourced, to the article. My schedule is pretty well booked for the foreseeable future, though, so here's hoping someone else will take a crack at it. \u2014 \u00b7 |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5uZVl94f8sx7H13j3xHX1WlRhzG", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930263, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3719, "completion_tokens": 71, "total_tokens": 3790}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 91.157.12.243 | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 2 | Wtshymanski | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Scheinwerfermann | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

In the US, the polycarbonate material and coating combination must be on the external_link of materials that are manufacturer-certified as having passed the tests specified in external_link; these include a 3-year outdoor exposure period in Arizona (sunny and dry) and the same in Florida (sunny and humid) after which no more than 30% haze is permitted. Outside the US, the wiki_link on headlamps contain requirements for plastic materials. They're broadly similar (polycarbonate material with coating) but they use an accelerated test with an electric source of UV light (an unshielded arc lamp) rather than putting the material samples out in the sun for a few years. Aside from some early experiments at GE with polycarbonate-lens sealed beams, the first plastic headlamp lenses in the US came out for 1984 on Ford's new-that-year composite replaceable-bulb headlamps. The choice of plastic rather than glass was entirely cost-based. European (rest of the world) regulations did not permit plastic lenses until 1993. The plastic materials are more versatile with respect to styling; more complicated shapes can more easily be moulded. And the plastic lenses weigh less, and are more compatible with European pedestrian-protection regulations governing maximum impact force on pedestrian legs, knees, etc.\n:::Glass headlamp lenses were and are made of either soda-lime \"soft\" glass or borosilicate \"hard\" glass, depending on the specific headlamp design and manufacturer. Sometimes lenses are further treated (tempered/toughened) for heavy-duty service as required by the intended application.\n:::Which one's better, plastic or glass? Neither, overall; each has its merits and drawbacks. Glass is breakable, but plastic cooks in the sun and can't effectively be polished (you wind up polishing the hard coat off the lens, then the degradation comes back faster and worse). Replaceable lenses aren't as common as they once were even outside North America because the complex shapes of today's styled headlamps make it very difficult to obtain a good and durable seal without gluing the lens to the housing. Within North America replaceable lenses have always been permitted but never been common because headlamps so equipped are subject to more stringent requirements for reflector durability and repeatable seal integrity, which means higher cost to manufacture.\n:::When I get a chance, I will try and add some or all of this material, appropriately sourced, to the article. My schedule is pretty well booked for the foreseeable future, though, so here's hoping someone else will take a crack at it. \u2014 \u00b7 |\n| 4 | JimScott | Which one's better, plastic or glass? Glass. In 40+ years of driving (more than 500,000 miles combined over a dozen or so vehicles), I have never had a glass lens get broken or cracked (other than the head-on highway collision we suffered in our 1969 Saab 95 which we all walked away from without a scratch BTW). Both of the glass lens on my 23-year-old Honda Accord LX Station Wagon are as clear as the day they were installed (and this car has been parked outside all of it's life). My wife's 2001 Suzuki XL-7, on the other hand, has these fancy plastic lens which have to be polished every few months in order to maintain any semblance of transparency. Surprise! The fancy plastic lens is NOT available separately and NON-OEM replacements list at $200 or more. The dealer quoted us roughly $1,300, installed, to replace both sides with \"genuine OEM\" parts. Know how much it costs to replace the Honda's headlight if and when it ever breaks? $50 each side (and that includes the sidelight as well). Plastic or glass? Please. The only reason plastic was let in back in 1983 is because everyone was all goo-goo gah-gah over plastic and trying to give everything the \"aero\" look to impress the ladies in charge with fancy pictures and such while trying to justify the millions being poured into CAD design systems. Plastic, in and of itself, is probably the worst material ever considered for a lens that has to maintain optical clarity under 24/7/365 exposure to direct sunlight. This is just another reason Marketing should NEVER be in charge when it comes to engineering decisions.

Everyone involved represents the state; not everyone involved represents the judiciary.\n The \"judiciary\" is too restrictive.  In a state where executions are at the discretion of an administrative hearing by the police, would we not call that capital punishment?\n In the same introduction, military justice is listed as a reason for capital punishment, administered by courts martial.  That does not always involve the judiciary.\n For the term \"state\", there is no proper noun \"State\", and this is not German, so there is no need to capitalize a noun.  I agree that it is important that a sovereign entity impose the punishment.  Parents can barely get away with corporal punishment.  Capital punishment by a parent (in most places) ''would'' be considered homicide. |\n| 8 | Coolcaesar | I concur with JCO312's analysis above.  I think we may be running into a difference in how the separation of powers is analyzed by political scientists in different countries.  In the United States, we characterize the executive branch as covering all employees who are under a direct line of authority running back to the state governor or the President of the United States.  Similarly, the legislative branch covers all members of Congress and their staffers, while the judiciary includes all federal judges plus the large number of administrators and clerks who keep the courts running.\nAlso, it is extremely rare for the courts to stay executions nowadays, and even when a stay is granted, it is only temporary.  The vast majority of courts now adhere to the theory that a prisoner's primary remedy is to appeal to the executive branch for clemency or pardon (which is rarely granted). |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5urc2WEFz4E95h0E42VR4amkdKZ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930281, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3073, "completion_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 3116}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7 | Dpv | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 8 | Coolcaesar | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

The judiciary is part of the State, and thus, is incorporated by reference.  I say, for the final time, you would be right if this article were about the death sentence; it is much more accurate to use the \"State\" in reference to capital punishment, as now 4 people have said. |\n| 3 | 203.217.91.1 | Well, could I possibly explain why the judiciary should be explicitly mentioned in the first paragraph (at least)? Here are my reasons: a) in a death penalty case, the judiciary imposes the sentence, b) most of the time, condemned people spend 99.999...% of their time fighting their sentence in the courts, c) in most cases, it is usually the courts that stay execution\nI have also asked one of my teachers (who studied political science at uni in France) and he agrees with me. Employees of the State, or public servants are not members of the branch and do not belong to and are not apart of any branch whatsoever in France. He also added that maybe it would be worth mentioning that police officers, nurses, teachers, etc. cannot be apart of the executive branch or be members of the executive branch or belong to the executive branch as they do not detain the executive power, they do not have the authority to make decisions or issue executive orders and do not have similar powers.\nThe only people (in France), who are members of any branch are:\n-executive: The President, the Prime Minister and his government\n-legislative: MPs and Senators\n-Judiciary: judges of the constitutional court, and judges of courts below that latter court\nI might have missed a couple of people, but I'm certain I got the most important ones. |\n| 4 | 203.217.91.1 | (written by GreatKing) |\n| 5 | ER MD | A few errors: France only has a department of surrender. Mentioning \"judiciary\" is incorrect since ditatorships may not have a separate judiciary.  \"State\" can be used but it is implied and obvious... mentioning the structure of the government or system that invokes capital punishment is not necessary.  Calling the person a \"convicted criminal\" implies a proceding, however careful or capricious, and by whatever governmental or military body.  Call it \"State\" but anybody with the ability to read would know that. I think it should just be omitted. |\n| 6 | JCO312 | France, as an abolitionist country, is an odd choice for a debate on the death penalty.  We seem now to have moved to a debate on whether police officers, prison guards, ect., are \"members\" of the executive or simply \"employees of the State.\"  Well, they are hired under the authority of the executive branch, can only be fired under the authority of the executive branch, report to higher ranked officials in the executive branch, and are paid out of the executive branches budget.  That being said, if it's the word \"members\" that you're hung up on, fine.  The fact is that even if they are simply \"employees of the State,\" they are certainly NOT employees or members of the judiciary.  Condemed prisoners (or their lawyers) might spend 99.9 percent of their time fighting through appeals (assuming you're in country that has an extensive appellate system), but they spend that time sitting in a prison, trying to avoid an act carried out exclusively by these other \"employees of the State.\"  I don't think the word \"State\" should be omitted, as it is the involvement of the State that seperates capital punishment from plain old murder. |\n| 7 | Dpv | I would concur that we should use \"state\" (without the current capitalization (no pun intended)) rather than judiciary for the following reasons:\n Anyone who carries out the execution, who orders it, or who determines that it is an available punishment represents the state in some way.\n for example, in the United States the executive (no pun intended) branch kills the convicted, the judiciary (sometimes a jury of \"peers\") sentences the convicted, and the legislative branch determines for what crimes death is an appropriate penalty.\n As JCO312 says, \"state\" is a nice general term.  Everyone involved represents the state; not everyone involved represents the judiciary.\n The \"judiciary\" is too restrictive.  In a state where executions are at the discretion of an administrative hearing by the police, would we not call that capital punishment?\n In the same introduction, military justice is listed as a reason for capital punishment, administered by courts martial.  That does not always involve the judiciary.\n For the term \"state\", there is no proper noun \"State\", and this is not German, so there is no need to capitalize a noun.  I agree that it is important that a sovereign entity impose the punishment.  Parents can barely get away with corporal punishment.  Capital punishment by a parent (in most places) ''would'' be considered homicide. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5umCck7fEiH3IXxaplM6j1dAFNV", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930276, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3712, "completion_tokens": 129, "total_tokens": 3841}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 220.245.178.135 | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 2 | JCO312 | Assured-Dominant |\n| 3 | 203.217.91.1 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 4 | 203.217.91.1 | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 5 | ER MD | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 6 | JCO312 | Assured-Dominant |\n| 7 | Dpv | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

You have yet to cite any authority for either of those points.  What you've said in this sentence, \"''there has not been a proven wrongful execution in the US (actually in the 1900's) and that there are indications that it deters murders, then the cost-benefit would support continued executions''\" actually does make logical sense, but to include anything about \"murderers killing in prison\" is so unrelated to that point that it makes no sense to include it.  As to why I disagree, it's pretty simple.  As written, it was an illogical argument that has never been advanced by proponents of capital punishment in any work I've ever seen (and had no citation). |\n| 7 | ER MD | Not an argument??? you have got to be kidding me.  Think about it for a while since its pretty easy to understand. Or let me explain...  One one extreme: Cost: zero wrongful executions. Benefit: prevent recidivism and saves thousands of lives. On the other extreme: Cost: multiple wrongful executions. Benefit: Zero lives saved by executing murderers and preventing recidivism. Simple cost and benefit.  Virtually every decision can be made along those line.  Proponents simply argue that the cost of potential/proven wrongful execution is \"vanishingly small\" in comparision to the lives saved by executing murderers.  opponents argue that the cost is high: potential/proven executions of innocents versus very little benefit or no prevented homicides. Also you again fail to read what I wrote stating \"letting murderers kill other people in prison and then releasing them.\"  That is not what I wrote, so I don't know why I am even discussing this matter with you.  Either you do not care what the real point was or you intentially want to mischaracterize the position to further your argument. Finally, do you really need to read it in a journal to understand the concept? Seems to me that this is common sense and debate 101. |\n| 8 | JCO312 | '''''Advocates argue that given the thousands of murders that have occured in prison and by murderers released from prison''', and given that there has not been a proven execution of an innocent (at least in the US), the cost-benefit analysis favors the retention of capital punishment.''  That's why you're having this discussion.  Perhaps now that you recall what you wrote, you can actually respond.  I'm probably asking too much, but maybe you can cut down on the snide and conceited way you've been doing it. |\n| 9 | ER MD | You are an idiot and you are proving it.

That's an illogical argument.  First of all, I take issue with the idea that thousands of murderers are committing murder in prison and being released.  What is your authority for that statement?  Second, unless you can also say that upon release they are killing more people, then how does that prove that the cost benefit favors execution.  This would be fine if you simply said \"there has not been any proven wrongful execution.\"  But to throw in those other unsupported assertions, which don't actually relate to the ultimate conclusion, is improper. |\n| 2 | ER MD | If you read the text correctly it did not state what you claim: that the same people who murder in prison are then released.  It is likely a different prison population (there are murderers in prison who murder again, and then there are murderers who don't, who subsequently are released and then murder again). Your statement: \"Second, unless you can also say that upon release they are killing more people, then how does that prove that the cost benefit favors execution\" makes no sense.  Have you not heard of people who have been convicted of murder and then have been released, ie parole??? Not all murderers get LWOP. Cost-benefit arugment: The cost to society is a dead murderer, and the benefit is innocent lives saved.  Follow? |\n| 3 | JCO312 | There's no need to be snide.  You're argument is still wrong.  If a convicted murderer is released (i.e. paroled) and doesn't do anything, there is no cost to society.  By the way, nearly every case that is eligible for capital punishment ''does'' get LWOP. |\n| 4 | Coolcaesar | I concur with JCO312; nearly every capital-eligible case either terminates in a sentence of death or life without parole.  But it also depends on the flexibility of the state's laws.  For example, in California, for many serious felonies, like the intentional wrecking of a train, the only sentencing choice available (once the charge has been presented and proved) is between LWOP and death.  Of course, there are lesser felonies which allow for more flexibility, but our prosecutors, as in most U.S. jurisdictions, like to bring the maximum charge that the facts will arguably support. |\n| 5 | ER MD | The cost-benefit perspective (including the risk of an innocent execution) is an aspect of the argument (irrespective if you agree or not).  Opponents argue that the cost of an innocent execution by the state is so wrong that they are willing to accept more murders by murderers in prison. Obviously they don't argue that point because at some point it becomes illogical.  Obviously, if the state had a wrongful execuation rate of 25% and the perceived deterence rate only prevented a few murders, one could argue in terms of cost-benefit that it does not make sense to continue with executions.  Proponents simply argue that the fact that there has not been a proven wrongful execution in the US (actually in the 1900's) and that there are indications that it deters murders, then the cost-benefit would support continued executions (i.e. it saves way more lives that the theoretical execution of an innocent in the US). Instead of it being \"wrong\" why don't you acurately reflect your '''opinion''' as you disagree.  Now do you understand? |\n| 6 | JCO312 | I have never read in a single scholarly text anyone make the argument that the cost-benefit has anything to do with letting murderers kill other people in prison and then releasing them.  You have yet to cite any authority for either of those points.  What you've said in this sentence, \"''there has not been a proven wrongful execution in the US (actually in the 1900's) and that there are indications that it deters murders, then the cost-benefit would support continued executions''\" actually does make logical sense, but to include anything about \"murderers killing in prison\" is so unrelated to that point that it makes no sense to include it.  As to why I disagree, it's pretty simple.  As written, it was an illogical argument that has never been advanced by proponents of capital punishment in any work I've ever seen (and had no citation). |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5uxJwycmOuOT9SRoQQeFsrVrUkH", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930287, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3556, "completion_tokens": 100, "total_tokens": 3656}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | JCO312 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | ER MD | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 3 | JCO312 | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 4 | Coolcaesar | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | ER MD | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 6 | JCO312 | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

This is a derogatory term and doesn't fit in a NPOV article. There are neutral ways to make clear that a state is dependent of another one. |\n| 2 | Sus scrofa | The term \"puppet state\" can be used as an insult, but this is also true for any number of terms. For example, the \"psychopath\" label is often thrown around as an insult, but it also has a technical definition and is used by doctors to describe a clearly defined medical condition. By searching for \"puppet state RSI\" on Google books I found plenty of sources that call the RSI a puppet state. This shows, I believe, that reliable sources use it and that it is not POV. The RSI was created and controlled by the Germans, so the Italians had no real power and it is therefore justified to call the RSI a puppet state (the term also adroitly conveys what sort of state it was). The RSI did more than depend on Germany, it had no autonomy. There is a difference between dependency and having your government run by a foreign power. There is also a difference between satellite and puppet states. Satellite states, such as Romania during the Cold War, were not directly controlled by the Soviet Union but could not leave the orbit of the Soviet Union. So Romania could refuse to send troops to Czechoslovakia in 1968, but could not leave the Warsaw Pact. |\n| 3 | Otto ter Haar | My remark is not about the specific relation between Germany and RSI but about the credibility of the use of the term \"puppet state\". The German and French Wikipedia both renounce the term as improper (German \"Dieser Begriff ist abwertend und wird daher ausschlie\u00dflich von Kritikern solcher Regierungen benutzt.\"; French \"Le terme est partisan et pol\u00e9mique, il est source de disputes s\u00e9mantiques.\") In both versions of the article about RSI a neutral description of the state is used. To that end I recommend to change the wording of the article as I did. It is hard to believe that any of the Italians which participated in the government of RSI regarded themselves as puppets. To brand them so is not a neutral observation but a political biased point of view. |\n| 4 | Sus scrofa | Usage of a term in other languages is irrelevant to usage in the English language; usage of this or that term can therefore vary across different language Wikipedias. For comparison, the Germans have a hair up their butt about the name Kristallnacht since the Nazis used it sarcastically to imply that the victims of the pogrom were rich fat cats crying over their expensive glassware being broken. Nobody in the English speaking world cares about this so Kristallnacht is the name universally used here and elsewhere. \"Neutral\" doesn't mean \"any description that doesn't offend anyone\", or we'd be calling the Kristallnacht a \"disagreement\", since \"pogrom\" is polemical and leads to semantic disputes. The terms used on the English language Wikipedia should be the same as those used by the reliable sources, the sources dictate what terms are used since Wikipedia should not conduct original research or be in the business of coining new terms. ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Italy'' is just one source that says: \"Mussolini, rescued from his mountain prison by German gliders, returned to Italy as the head of a puppet Fascist State\". I could go on listing sources that use the term without prejudice. The \"puppet state\" metaphor handily conveys what sort of relationship the RSI had with Germany. Germany wanted total control combined with the appearance of a sovereign Italian state. This separates the puppet state from a colony where the power relationship is openly one-sided.\n\"It is hard to believe that any of the Italians which participated in the government of RSI regarded themselves as puppets.\" This is completely irrelevant; ask anyone in the North Korean government and they'll swear up and down that North Korea is a democracy. This does not mean we need to go along with the charade. Any Italian in a position of power who worked for the RSI knew the score, that much seems self-evident. |\n| 5 | Professortimithy | I agree that \"puppet state\" is a pejorative term that is only used by opponents and critics of the sponsoring nation. The term Provisional Government is a more neutral term. Even the Wikipedia article for Puppet State says the same thing, that it is derogatory. While the Wikipedia article for Provisional Government concedes \"Provisional government is an emergency or interim government set up when a political void has been created by the collapse of a very large government\" and \"Provisional governments are generally unelected and tend to arise in association with or in the aftermath of civil or foreign wars. In a time of crisis a collapsed government may reform with provisional status under a coalition.\" |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5vK3QaInnR03CYlSsXJYt3d8Mdg", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930310, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3654, "completion_tokens": 93, "total_tokens": 3747}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Otto ter Haar | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Sus scrofa | Assured-Dominant |\n| 3 | Otto ter Haar | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 4 | Sus scrofa | Assured-Dominant |\n| 5 | Professortimithy | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

So i chose a middle number. a middle number between 700k and 1 mil. is 850.000. Go through dozens of other sources on internet, you will find these estimations even higher ... stating always around, up to 1 million or more than 1 million people of serbian origin in usa... including a fact that a vast majority of people who declare as Yugoslavs are Serbs by origin, and alot of those who assimilated - simply everything that is written in that source... the numbers of estimations can add up. There are several other ethnic group articles like \"English people\" like \"Greeks\" or \"Bosniaks\" or \"Bulgarians\" or several other articles... that use higher estimations for certain countries like USA. So why wouldnt Serbs article use a higher estimation? ... The sources are from U.S. Embassy and Serbian consule in Chichago.. I think its a good edit and if these sources are POV ... then all sources all over the internet, dozens of them, serbian or american or someone elses that estimate a ca. 1mil. number... are Pov by you.

Your false accusements continue against me and so do your nationalist provocations. Again... that source was on even be4 i got to wikipedia, but nvm that... , it would be a good idea to put that source in.. or as for that.. we can put a source of up to 1 million people of Serbian origin in the U.S. as a higher estimation i wouldnt have anything against, just make it reliable. Largest Serbian diaspora lives in Usa and Germany, this is why we need a higher estimation for the U.S. where undoubtebly live atleast up to 1 million ppl of Serbian origin. Let me give you an example and comparison with Norwegians.... at the end of 19th century there was about 17,000 Norwegians living in the U.S. and about 20,000 Montenegrin Serbs alone...

A while back, I made a comment here on the talk page that there was such a push to make this a GA that the integrity and encyclopedic tone of the article was being lost.  And it seems I was right (even though I was chastised by Loeba and Dr. B for saying so).  You're not nuts OhC and your assessment is correct. If the issue wasn't resolved then the tag should be replaced.    \u25cf |\n| 2 | TrueHeartSusie3 | I'm hesitant to get involved in this, but what I wonder is \u2013 if you all find that the article is not up to standard, why not improve it yourself? Isn't that the point of WP that everyone can make changes and that articles are the result of collaborative effort?  So rather than complaining about the article on this talk page, why don't you make the edits to it which you find necessary?   TrueHeartSusie3 |\n| 3 | Winkelvi | Yes, that's the point of Wikipedia, but it rarely happens that way.  Especially when someone has their sights set on GA status for an article.  What I've seen and run into in the past is a feeling of ownership while on the path to GA.  When someone not considered part of the GA crew tries to change things it turns into an argument and/or edit war.  What should be collaborative editing becomes a pain in the ass for the outsiders.  And, certainly, that's not the point of WP.  I've done a few things here and there in this article but have made sure to tread very lightly since I was chastised by Dr. B.  My feeling was \"What's the point?\"   \u25cf |\n| 4 | TrueHeartSusie3 | All I'm saying is, and this is not just to you but also to the commenters above who find the article to be a quotefarm/shrine \u2013 actions speak louder than words. I'm sure that if you argue your point without any snark, there won't be any 'ownership issues'. Blofeld and Loeba are respected editors who have quite a bit of experience on improving articles, and I don't think either of them is opposed to constructive criticism if it is done with the acknowledgement of the hours that they have spent improving this article and hence with respect and not with snark. Imagine how you would feel if you had spent loads of your free time (and possibly your money in getting hold of the necessary source material) trying to genuinely improve an article, and then someone who hasn't ever attempted to improve the article in a significant way comes and gives criticism which could have been constructive, but which is instead laced with snark and arrogance? Yes, that is going to provoke a negative reaction which can seem like proclaiming ownership. I want to believe that none of us is on this talk page out of wanting to create drama but that we are all interested in improving this article \u2013 so let's work together and respect each other and assume good will rather than argue. I'm personally not opposing having less quotes or making major changes to the article \u2013 but what I have very little patience for is when editors point out issues vaguely without any propositions of how, in practice, the article could be improved. Now, any concrete ideas on that?  TrueHeartSusie3 |\n| 5 | Ohnoitsjamie | I think a good start would be pruning two of the quotes.

I think maybe your \"tagging\" was ineffective because a lot of people are irritated by tagging, which leaves an ugly big complaining box right at the top of a page. Always better to bring your issues to the talk page (and then you can be  far more specific with what you disapprove of - tagging rarely makes this clear).  Show me a diff from when I \"chastised\" you, please. Seriously, I'd really like to see when I was so awful to you.  You've hit the nail on the head perfectly. I didn't edit this article looking for praise and appreciation, it was because I genuinely wanted to work on it, but it does bother me when people start making comments with ''only'' negative things to say. OhC, Wikelvi and  presumably you all appreciate Hoffman and have an interest in the article, so would it hurt to show some appreciation for our expansion? Even if you think there are problems with it, would you rather the page went back to this? Which version do you think is a better resource? So it would just be nice if you could manage \"Thanks for all the work you've put into the article, but...\" Now going back to the point under discussion: I disagree that it's like a shrine, for the reasons outlined above - I genuinely wouldn't have the article any different if he was still alive - and sometimes I wonder if people go the other way and become ''extra''-sensitive to anything that could be construed as special attention because he died. \"We '''must''' show that his death makes no difference to us! Wikipedia has no emotion! People will respect us if we show restraint!\" But I just can't see that this is useful to readers. I personally think we should make clear what his position was in the film industry, and we should give some indication of the reaction to his death. Just as we report on his childhood and the roles he played throughout his career, these are important elements of his story that [I think] belong in his article. However, if there's really several of you who still think it's problematic (in light of my comments - obviously I'm going to attempt to sway you towards my opinion, that's not \"ownership\" it's just how debating works) then something should change. I already removed a couple of the quote boxes after this discussion, so I'm not sure why a certain user is acting like I'm so unbendable, but I can't read your minds so yes - if you're still unhappy, it would be best if you just made some changes yourself or at least made specific suggestions... [Which Jamie has now done since my edit conflict, thank you.

It is undisputed that Korea, in its myriad of ethno-political forms, borrowed considerably from China both culturally and politically.  But to somehow assert that Korea may have somehow originated with the migration and settlement of a Chinese family on the Peninsula is not only unsubstantiated, it should be viewed as a deliberate attempt to undermine Korea's own history as well as the abundance of anthropological evidence which documents the presence of an indigenous peoples on the Peninsula long before the existence of a formal Chinese state.  One need only look at the revisionist sinocentric histories of Tibet and Formosa (Taiwan) that were promulgated by China to \"evidence\" its \"ancient\" claims to the lands.  China is, and always has been, a hegemony that has grown in size over many centuries.  This growth has been patient and steady.  But it has relied on a long series of small falsehoods and on occasion, outright aggression.  Tibet is the clearest demonstration of this.  Military troops invaded, murdered, and pillaged.  The historical documents were destroyed.  And China engaged in a policy of seizing Tibetan land and redistributing it to resettled \"Han Chinese\".  China, it is suspected, is supporting the Maoist \"rebels\" in neighboring Nepal; these well-funded terrorists have succeeded in murdering the royal family and creating political and economic chaos.  Maybe in time, it too will be overtaken by China.  Not surprisingly, border disputes have been common; China and Mongolia, China and Vietnam, China and India (they actually fought in a short-lived war), China and Japan, China and Russia, China and the Philippines (Spratley Islands), etc.  And now, China is at it again, attempting to revise Korean history (and its geography) with the recent controversial decision (official state policy) to downplay and discount the Korean origin of the Kogoryo Kingdom (one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea), which claimed territory on the northern parts of the Peninsula as well as parts of what was then Manchuria.  Any astute observer of Chinese history will see this move for what it is, another small lie in a long chain of lies that will lead, possibly, to \"historical claims\" to Korea. |\n| 2 | DestinyX | -I am not sure whether the article is Sinocentric biased, however, i am sure the person who rasied the issue about Sinocentric above is biased and maybe contains somekind of racist or maybe more accurate nationalist right-winged.\nIn the issue about how \"evil\" of the Chinese expansion is or other, i suggest the issue rasier to do deeper reaserchs about human history. Since i cannot see any civilisation in any human history in the world is not expansionist. In respond to the critics about the Tibet issue, Taiwan issue... i would rather ask how about the unifications of any nations in the world, including the Korea and its ancient states (How come there is a Korea? how the Koreans expaned from none before the history till now there is a large group of people who call themslves Korean? and how come there were three independent states in the Korean Three kingdoms period but now there is only one call Korea or maybe two Koreas? Most importantly, plsease tell me why and how a nation is formed and why a group of people so call themselves a nation can claim some lands that exist before human and belong to no one their territory? etc.) Then, i think i cannot see any point of the above writer's get any valid standpoints, other than maybe some kind of Chauvinism.\nPS. the contents of above paragraph does not hold any valid standpoints, simply because lack of any evidence and more subjective to the writer's personal view rather than any objective supports.                                                                                              (I agree with you, that person who hates China is so paranoid. we should calm he or her down. tell he or she to relax.) |\n| 3 | Wikimachine | I agree. China is spending billions of dollars right now researching to prove that Balhae is part of Chinese history/culture. I'll take a look at it.

I can't believe that Chinese people are claiming that.\nThe only reason why I think they are like that is because they are jealous of Korean history and how Goguryeo was as powerful as China.(:-)Chinese are jealous of Korean history?

In particular, the expulsion and near extermination of the natives somewhat undermines the believability of this noble origin myth.  \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by |\n| 2 | Victoriaearle | Yes, I agree. I've removed the paragraph. As there's little in the body of the article to support/develop those assertions, per WP:Lead we should stick to the facts on the page. Thanks for noting. |\n| 3 | Hertz1888 | I do not agree with the wholesale removal of this paragraph, or the hasty timing. One editor agreeing with another does not spell consensus, and two hours is by no means sufficient to allow for discussion.  Something comparable to a week's time, perhaps longer, might be more appropriate.  To keep or not to keep are not the only options; someone with the appropriate historical background might like to rework the paragraph to make it more neutral.  There is room to at least mention and put in context the iconic nature of the voyage in American history, for which it shouldn't be difficult to find ample citations.  I view the central tenet of the original comment as overreaction, as I'm not aware of the Mayflower passengers having expelled or nearly exterminated anyone. |\n| 4 | Mugginsx | I also disagree with the removal of this paragraph.  Thank you for the notification of this discussion Hertz1888.  In addition, I agree with all of your comments.  The Mayflower experience is not mythical, it is based upon many documents written contemporaneously with the experience.  Not only did the ''Mayflower'' passengers not exterminate anyone in their time, but lived, for the most part, alongside the Native American population in friendship while trading and learning from each other.  See: articles Squanto and Massasoit and others  Later conflict with the indigenous population are not attributed to the ''Mayflower'' passengers and their causes can be historically compared to those of many countries in the world.

Given that there seems to be a general belief that newcomers find our talk pages too intimidating to navigate, (see long discussion on Wikipedia talk:Flow), I took the time to read the IP's comment, looked at the article, and agreed. Here's the paragraph I removed:\n\nSpecifically, phrase by phrase, here are my objections, which to some extent have to do with the scope of article. Is the article about a ship or about Plymouth Colony? The paragraphs begins by saying: '''This voyage has become an iconic story'''. Okay, yes, probably true, but I'd suggest delinking ''iconic''. Then it says: '''in the earliest annals of American history'''. The phrase seems to suggest American history began in the winter of 1621-22. What about the voyages made by the Vikings in the medieval period, Christopher Columbus's voyage (though, unlike the Vikings, he didn't quite get to the mainland), and the slightly earlier voyages made to Jamestown, Virginia and Roanoke Colony? And clearly the continent was already settled by the Native Americans, and had been for tens of thousands of years, so it seems to suggest their history doesn't exist. Either it needs to be rewritten or removed. Then it goes on to say: '''with its tragic story of death and of survival in the harshest New World winter environment'''. I'd suggest removing ''tragic'' and simply state that about 50 percent of the passengers didn't survive the first winter. But again, this is an issue of scope and I'd further suggest that material is better covered in the Plymouth Colony article. According to this article the passengers spent the winter on the ship but that information is contrary to what the diaries tell us: they were building houses as early as December and I think it was about January that the hall was built. Again, material for the other article, imo. The ''death and survival'' also belongs in the other article - the voyage was finished. The ''harshest New England winter environment'' is putting it a little strongly. In fact that winter was relatively mild, not a lot of snow, the harbor wasn't frozen, they were able to fell trees and build, etc., etc. A ref (Bradford) has now been added to this statement: '''The culmination of the voyage in the signing of the Mayflower Compact is one of the greatest moments in the story of America, providing the basis of the nation's present form of democratic self-government and fundamental freedoms'''. But, Bradford simply describes the writing and signing of the Charter - which indeed was an important document but oddly not a lot of said about it here - as soon as they decided to build in Plymouth. We can't use Bradford to cite that the document provided the basis for the ''nation's present form of self-government''. I think we should mention in this article the specific details from Bradford and then turn the implications and analysis over to be dealt with in the body the Mayflower Compact page. I also don't think this article suffers much from having that lead paragraph removed. Anyway, that's my reasoning. |\n| 6 | Mugginsx | Victoriaearle, As an editor since 2008 with 24,533 edits, and creator of several articles which I am not even going to try to count, I do not understand what you are saying here.  This article is about the ship and the historic voyage. As to one of them, my answer is: ''Not everyone reads every article on a subject''.  If you wish to read more about the Mayflower Compact please look at the article with that name.  It is linked in blue for that exact purpose. The Mayflower Compact is mentioned briefly because it was signed on the ship toward the end of the voyage.  Also, why would you want to de-link \"Iconic\".  The purpose of linking is for persons who may not understand what a word means.  I would suggest that you read Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking. The rest of your objections I will look at one to one but the article is referenced appropriately and the wp:Scope is appropriate.  If you understand the American Constitution you will understand the statement about the Mayflower Compact.  The Vikings remark....really?  I don't know what to say about that.  Bradford is the author of the account of the voyage and I does not confirm any facts about the comparison of the Mayflower Compact to the United States Consitution.  I see that Bowman is already in place to reference that statement. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5vzk6UAwu0aRTtGrm2QIdzZFROy", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930351, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3754, "completion_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 3813}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Mugginsx | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | Victoriaearle | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | Mugginsx | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

This article is about the ship and the historic voyage. As to one of them, my answer is: ''Not everyone reads every article on a subject''.  If you wish to read more about the Mayflower Compact please look at the article with that name.  It is linked in blue for that exact purpose. The Mayflower Compact is mentioned briefly because it was signed on the ship toward the end of the voyage.  Also, why would you want to de-link \"Iconic\".  The purpose of linking is for persons who may not understand what a word means.  I would suggest that you read Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking. The rest of your objections I will look at one to one but the article is referenced appropriately and the wp:Scope is appropriate.  If you understand the American Constitution you will understand the statement about the Mayflower Compact.  The Vikings remark....really?  I don't know what to say about that.  Bradford is the author of the account of the voyage and I does not confirm any facts about the comparison of the Mayflower Compact to the United States Consitution.  I see that Bowman is already in place to reference that statement. |\n| 7 | Victoriaearle | Hi  per WP:BRD I boldly deleted a paragraph,  reverted my edit, and I made a thoughtful comment explaining my reasons. Before I commented I checked Bradford and various other sources I have at hand. You've made what I think are a couple of fairly rude replies, here, which was then refactored here. It's probably best not to refactor and best not to personalize. If someone else wants to join the conversation, I think that would be a good idea. As it now stands, the second paragraph could do with a rewrite. But I don't want to get into a long and acrimonious talk page discussion which does nothing but prevent improving the material under discussion. |\n| 8 | Mugginsx | I am sorry you found my remarks inappropriate.  After re-reading them, I will attempt to make myself clearer.  I am a direct person and find that to be the best way to communicate.  If you found my remarks rude, you have my apology.  I do believe that before removing any material you MUST have a WP guideline which substantiates your reason for removal.  At least that has always been the way it has been here at Wiki as long as I have been an editor.  So far, you have no consensus to remove the material.  I welcome any other editor to comment here.  Lastly, I am allowed to re-factor my comments until they have been answered, at which time I would have then drawn a line through them. |\n| 9 | 68.112.148.213 | Hello, I am the anonymous reader who submitted the initial criticism. I will admit to being somewhat intimidated by talk pages. However, I must stand by my position that the paragraph in question violates neutrality. Even acknowledging that no individual Mayflower passenger massacred the natives, they were nonetheless among the first waves of a population transfer that was predicated upon the removal of the natives (who I do not think would consider this event to be \"great.\") The most egregiously partisan phrase is obviously \"one of the greatest moments in the story of America.\" The previous commenter was absolutely correct in pointing to the centuries of American history before European colonization. Furthermore, it is not Wikipedia's place to indicate what is and is not \"great,\" although the simple addition of \"it is considered to be...\" would accurately show the importance of the story within American culture, while maintaining this institution's vital neutral stance. I only present these criticisms because of my respect for the institution of Wikipedia and the plethora of knowledge that it has brought me. Finally, I do accept that debate and due process must be carried out before a decision is taken, and also that- as another commenter put it- the \"wholesale removal\" of this paragraph is not necessary. It simply and quite apparently needs a serious rewriting. |\n| 10 | 68.112.148.213 | Also, the linking of \"iconic\" and the reference to a questionably relevant \"source\" actually amplifies my feeling that this is a debatable political position that requires defending even through unconventional means.  \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by |\n| 11 | Rus793 | As you are unaccustomed to talk pages at Wikipedia, might I suggest you read over Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines.

That role is fundamental to his identity as Christ, the Son. The lead and the article in general don't pay much attention to Jesus as savior. In Christianity, isn't \"savior\" a distinctive role for Christ? Isn't the point of Jesus that those who believe in him are saved and have eternal life? The lead talks about Christians worshiping him, but it's more than that. Christians rely on him to save them from hell, right? To gain eternal life? The lead talks about Jesus' returning, but it doesn't explain the circumstances. He's coming back to judge the living and the dead, right? Judgment Day. I know that these days lots of Christian groups don't talk about Judgment Day or hell as much as they used to, but it seems like we're missing a vital element in understanding Jesus. Or at least the Christian perspective on Jesus, which is notable. |\n| 2 | Ian.thomson | Yes, Christians would almost universally call Jesus savior, but the meaning varies quite a bit from denomination to sect.  I normally advocate looking through the sources and summarizing them, but Google books is glutted with, making it a bit hard to kind the stuff we'd need like Wiley-Blackwell or Brill Publishers.  Going through existing articles and citations, I managed to cobble together:\n\"Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God,(cite: Oxford Companion to the Bible p.649; found at Jesus in Christianity), and attribute important roles to him in Christian eschatology, including judging the dead(cite:''Introducing Christian Doctrine'' (2nd Edition) by Millard J. Erickson (Apr 1, 2001) ISBN 0801022509 pages 391-392; found at Kingdom of God (Christianity)) before or after their resurrection,(cite: refs 6-10 at Christian mortalism).  Additionally, most Christians believe that Jesus either has established, is establishing, will establish the kingdom of heaven, with some modern and postmodern theologians positing that eschatology is largely symbolic, and Jesus's role in eschatology has more existential or societal implications than concerns about the afterlife.(cite: The Concise Dictionary of Christian Theology By Millard J. Erickson, p. 95; found at Idealism (Christian eschatology))\"\nOddly, I've run into a lot of Christians discussing such matters, but I live in a region where a used book store would see no problem putting Left Behind somewhere between Karl Barth and Martin Luther in the \"religious\" section, while chucking the Tao Te Ching next to Tony Robbins and Think and Grow Rich in the \"self-help\" section.  Admittedly, it's not as casual a conversation topic as it was from 1998 to 2002 and from 2010 to 2013. |\n| 3 | StAnselm | I strongly object to the wikilinks to Preterism, etc. - I think it's a bit simplistic to connect that to whether the kingdom has been or is being established, etc. I think the paragraph is a good start, but it seems a bit weighted towards eschatology. |\n| 4 | Ian.thomson | How about:\n\"Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God,(cite: Oxford Companion to the Bible p.649; found at Jesus in Christianity), and will judge the dead(cite:''Introducing Christian Doctrine'' (2nd Edition) by Millard J. Erickson (Apr 1, 2001) ISBN 0801022509 pages 391-392; found at Kingdom of God (Christianity)) either before or after their resurrection;(cite: refs 6-10 at Christian mortalism) though some believe Jesus's role as savior has more existential or societal concerns than the afterlife,(cite: The Concise Dictionary of Christian Theology By Millard J. Erickson, p. 95; found at Idealism (Christian eschatology)) and a few notable theologians have suggested that Jesus will bring about a Universal reconciliation.(cite: Richard Bauckham, \"Universalism: a historical survey\", ''Themelios'' 4.2 (September 1978): 47\u201354. ; found at Universal reconciliation)\"\nWould that work?  Meant to include the universal reconciliation bit initially, but it got lost in the eschatology. |\n| 5 | StAnselm | Sorry - I was forgetting this was a section on eschatology! So there is no problem with that weight, of course.

The simple reason is, that nothing notable really happened since the Syriza-government won the election. A lot of posturing and comments were made by the new Greek government, but no notable movement/action took place. Hopefully we can soon write a subchapter explaining the contents of some new re-negotiated and implemented terms for the current Troika bailout programme, but until that happens everything is pretty much up in the air.\nAfter having followed the topic quiet intense, I am a bit concerned about the recent political statements made by various Greek government spokesmen, as it appear they either \"say something which they know is not possible/true\" (as part of attempting to score easy political points and/or appear more responsible than they actually are)\" or suffer from a complete unawareness of the fundamental rules of the eurozone. In example, Varoufakis continue to suggest, as of 14 May 2015, that ECB through a debt-swap should reschedule the Greek government repayments of earlier issued ECB-bonds (suggesting Draghi is willing to do it - if the Bundesbank did not restrain his maneuver options) - although all of us having passed the basic course in EU politics know that both the letter of the founding Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union and the ECB statute strictly prohibit ECB from conducting fiscal policy and/or offer debt-finance or debt-relief to some of its members (which is something that only the Eurogroup can make political decisions about). Asking ECB to unease liquidity constraints and/or reschedule debt repayments is simply equal to ask for something which is not an available tool in the tool box (they can not do something which the treaty prohibit them to do - and therefor solely base their liquidity offers to the Greek financial system based on observations for their specific needs - and not the potential need for funds subsequently to get transferred from the Greek banks to the Greek government - and if the Greek government at some point of time is incapable of repaying what they owe to ECB then ECB will keep their repayment claims unaltered - leaving a scenario of either a sovereign default or the Eurogroup+IMF to come to the rescue by offering a new third bailout programme so that Greece can honor its repayment commitments). Likewise, it is pretty clear that all locked bailout funds in the current bailout programme, can only be unlocked the moment the Troika review find that Greece actually has implemented all of the original payment terms - or alternatively some mutually agreed substituting terms - before this happen the Eurogroup (which it made absolutely clear through various statements issued since February 2015), will not approve the unlocking of any remaining frozen bailout pledges in the current programme - and they even clarified that before the current programme had been successfully completed by Greece \"no negotiations would start about a potential third follow-up programmme for covering the Greek needs after 1 July 2015\". Despite of this very clear fact, the Greek government repeatedly suggest towards the media, that an extraordinary Eurogroup will soon be called to approve a new deal, which is direct (intended/unintended) misinformation, as we all know (except apparently the Greek government) that the Troika needs both: (1) First to strike a mutually agreed deal with the Greek government about some renewed payment terms and (2) then publish an updated review-report concluding such terms have actually been implemented by the Greek government (through laws in parliament), before (3) The Eurogroup then finally can approve releasing the remaining funds in the current bailout-programme (which in best case - because of all the work before then still needed to be done - now only is possible at the earliest in the second half of June 2015). To conclude, this extra topic about potential \"unawareness of fundamental rules of the eurozone\", is also something I currently hesitate to write a sub-chapter about, at least for the moment, as it might too be a temporary non-notable event and/or just a \"political game\".\nAs we are all right now in a waiting game to learn what exactly happens, this is also the explanation why no specific \"negotiation news\" so far has been added to the article. We are all waiting for specific substantial news, which hopefully soon will arrive. |\n| 2 | Thanatos666 | Please abstain from such commentaries and stick to the facts as much as possible; let me just say that your views on the EU/\u20ac\u0396 '''Power Game''' - cause that's what it is in short - are not universally accepted... ;-) PS1.

It started out as an attempt to figure out, when it would be appropriate to add a sub-chapter about the current negotiations. My own conclusion after elaborating a bit on the topic, was the same as yours, that we have to wait until the negotiations have ended, and then report the results by a fact-styled manor. Perhaps my post just in the process got a bit polluted by my personal growing frustration, that even the negotiation process itself (and what role ECB can possibly play), is something the current Greek government fails to understand (or at least spin false tales about to the media).\nFor sure I do not claim to know the outcome of negotiations, but the negotiation framework and ECB's role, were both matters being fixed before negotiations started (regulated by treaty agreements, ECB statue, ESM statute, and the Eurogroup decision issued \"Feb.20\" not to start negotiations about a follow-up programme before negotiations and implementation of the current programme had been completed successfully), and this negotiation framework can not be changed in any possible way - meaning the process is limited to be all about whether or not a mutual agreement about adjusted payment terms can be settled between the Greek government at one side and with IMF and the Commission's working staff group at the other (and if this is achieved, the process will then move to the next step, being the \"implementation of terms by passing laws in the greek parliament\", and then thirdly the final review report will be published by the Commission's working staff group, and fourthly the Eurogroup will then convene and approve the transfer(s) of bailout funds to Greece, and fifthly the Eurogroup at the same time will start a negotiation process for starting up a follow-up programme supposed to cover the time period after the current programme end on 30 June). This outlined process is a fact, which already now can be sourced by various previous statements issued by the Eurogroup, and will at least be clear to all of us when (and if) the negotiations someday will complete successfully. I send my apology for posting such a long comment about it though, my bad. I agree with you, it is appropriate in all circumstances, now to await the final outcome of negotiations before we add a subchapter about it in the article. Best regards, |\n| 4 | Thanatos666 | 1. Rules, deals, agreements, laws and treaties are commonly interpreted at will and/or bypassed/bent and/or broken outright, e.g. 1, 2. Especially by those who have the power to do so and who are often the ones who set the rules in the first place. This is hardly a novel phaenomenon...2. Sure, let's take something that at the very least isn't working (need I say that this is a huge understatement?) and most probably isn't supposed to work in the way it's been declared to do so (or equivalently it's working fine, perfectly, but not in the stated manner; 3), and let's extend and pretend (after all these Greek guys are relatively far far away at a place few people see and for those who do see it, it's when they are on summer holidays partying); pretend it's working then when fail, goto start. Because after all rules are rules...PS In short, it's probably meaningless to argue over this, however fun it would be were it not for the problem that this is not a forum; our view on the...''universe'' is a bit different... ;-) || |\n| 5 | Arnoutf | There is no way to follow this with any reasonable effort.

Clear example of WP:TLDNR |\n| 6 | Danish Expert | @: Yes, some of the operating rules can be interpreted to a certain degree by the political institutions (i.e. the Eurogroup). But nobody has the power to change the fundamental rules and procedures. In example, ECB can never accept writing-off debt that a Member State directly owe to ECB (as such a thing would be equal to a breach of the fundamental \"no government financing\"-rule). Just like it is written in stone in a similar way, how the negotiation process is conducted for ''Accession of new EU Member States'', where the candidates always are required first to complete a specific outlined process of having 36 chapters opened and successfully closed before an accession treaty subsequently can be signed to let them into the club as a new EU member. Your referral to the example of slack historic governance of the Stability and Growth Pact (which is something the Eurogroup solely was responsible for), can not be used to conclude its now possible for ECB freely to interpret and change its \"fundamental rules\" of operating. It is a complete no-go if ECB breaches its fundamental mandate and start acting politically, as such a move would inevitably shortly afterwards end up in constitutional courts and be declared illegal. By the way the European institutions are constructed, no political negotiation (or rule bending) is allowed in ECB, which is required to operate strictly within its inflation-mandate, while all sorts of \"political negotiation\" and/or approval of new negotiated bailout deals is a matter solely for the Eurogroup to approve (because they have the democratic mandate of actually representing the political will and judgement of voters in the eurozone member states, which is something the central bank governors never can do).\nWhen the current Greek government point a blaming finger towards ECB, this can either be because they lack understanding of how the \"fundamental rules\" work or some political spin fired-off for the sole purpose of running a political game of ''\"lets blame the institutions for something which they are not responsible for - just to alleviate the political pressure/opposition that we otherwise would face on home soil from Greek voters - because of our poor way of running the negotiations\"''.\nAll this fuss put aside, I think we (at least for now) should avoid to debate this issue further. We both agree on the conclusion, namely that it is now appropriate to await conclusion of the negotiations before writing a subchapter about it. When the dust settles, everything will be much more clear. I can guarantee you in advance, that none of the fundamental rules will be broken (i.e. ECB will keep playing a political neutral game and not in any way directly interfere in the political process). Perhaps the Eurogroup might reverse their \"Feb.20-decision\" about keeping negotiations separate for respectively \"completion of the current programme\" and the expected \"follow-up programme starting on 1 July\" (because they have the political power to do so if they find it appropriate), but it would be very irresponsible for the Greek government to cling its hope and negotiation position at such a dangerous bet.\nIn any case, the only story the wikipedia article currently can depict (to avoid speculative content and crystal balling), is the one describing the negotiation timeline and negotiation process approved by the Eurogroup on 20 February. I also think, you agree with me on this strictly limited editorial point, which btw imply no need for changes to the current content of the article. |\n| 7 | Arnoutf | People, talk pages are about discussing concrete proposals for page improvement. Unless someone can make such a proposal in less than 400 characters (so that people may actually read it), I suggest we stop this as it seems more an opinion piece than anything else right now. |\n| 8 | Bobrayner | I agree with Arnoutf. The sheer volume of text, in the article and on the talkpage, is making it very difficult for others to resolve problems and suggest improvements. |\n| 9 | Danish Expert | I already posted my unconditional apology, for having written the initial long post in this debate. My last reply (updated 20 May), summarize the debate and conclusion of it (and featured six sourced bullet point examples - which if we utilized as material in the article in my opinion only would generate non-notable content). My proposal was, to formulate it more short and clearly, that we right now shall refrain to create a subchapter describing the \"negotiation process on updated terms for conclusion of the 2nd programme\", actually so we avoid walls of text in the article describing non-notable events. My argument is, the outcome of the negotiations posses encyclopedic value (so eventually we can create a subchapter under the 2nd programme entitled ''\"Agreement on updated terms for conclusion of the programme\"''), but featuring a chapter about the negotiation process itself (describing its present current state) in my opinion conflict with WP:NOTABLE and WP:NOTNEWS - and therefor should be avoided.  replied above, that he agreed with me on this proposed editorial line, to await the final outcome of negotiations before creating a subchapter about it. Other editors are of course welcome to chime in, if they have any arguments against this proposed ''\"wait and see - only report conclusive final facts\"'' editorial line.

The attempt was only partly successful, as this move indeed succeeded to put a brief end to its second recession in Q2-2009, but at the same time the statistical fraud (serving the purpose for the government to keep the private lending market alive as a cheap refinancing source by telling them the incorrect fiscal figures) was discovered. When the statistical fraud had been revealed, it caused a double penalty for Greece: (1) Financial market trust fell deeply into negative territory (twice as deep as if the Government only had reported correct statistics straight from the start), (2) Economic sentiments in Greece (both among consumers and companies) were nuked deep down into negative territory, which caused the third Greek recession to start already in Q3-2009, as everybody suddenly realized how bad a state the current Greek economy actually was in.\nThis early 2009-context is important to note, as it represent the explanation why \"implementation of austerity\" subsequently was needed for the Greek government to implement (as a main condition when the Troika arrived to rescue Greece in May 2010). In a perfect theoretical world, where both the private lending market and public creditors still possessed 100% fiscal trust, that it was possible to continue unconditional lending to Greece of cheap (low-interest-rate) money during a long lasting Greek government debt-crisis, and then be certain the Greek government subsequently - when strong growth had been revived - then by-it-self at this later point of time then would start to implement heavy doses of needed austerity to fix the problem of still having operated a screwed \"structural balance and debt-to-GDP ratio\", then YES all experts agree this path would have been far better for Greece (compared to implementing fiscal austerity straight away).

I think there are three parties to blame for the initial mess. Goldman Sachs for its amoral trick (and grabbed payment) to present Greece's situation as better than it was. The European (especially North Western European) banks for loaning Greece for interest rates not taking account of the actual risks (which they knew - and considered secured by their too big too fail status ). And the 2000-2008 Greek governments that showed lack of self control in borrowing far too much, for unrealistic interest rates. The first two agents being amoral, the third being mainly na\u00efve the response from many European governments utterly fits the current dominance of the \"objective\" neoliberal view that naivety is a sin and amorality a virtue. Hence we save the banks and sacrifice the Greeks.\nMy ironic view on neoliberalism here is probably not the most neutral point of view but not intended for article space anyway ;-) |\n| 5 | Danish Expert | @: Perhaps to your surprise, I can agree with you on your point, that we also had presence of most of your objectionable points. Although only to the extend, that they exist as supplementary (less important) points/views in addition to the ones reflected by my initial post. Here you have my reply in short:\n '''Greece had its maneuver room restricted by being a eurozone-member:''' Yes of course - saying goodbye to the devaluation tool and default option, is the price you pay for receiving lower interest rates, ECB liquidity support and become a member of financial support mechanisms. Still the EU+Eurogroup in fact issued a common response when the Great Recession had erupted, allowing all its members (who could afford it) to respond with supportive Keynesian economics during the first two years of the Great Recession (2008+2009) - due to the severity of this global recession, so that active fiscal support initially was injected into all healthy economies. My point was, that UK could afford it and actually did it (as stated in their 2008-09 Convergence report). While Greece could not afford it, but despite of this did it anyway in 2009, while pretending it could afford it by hiding its correct statistical figures for its true fiscal position. Of course this \"hiding the truth\" was only possible for a limited amount of time, and it only made the subsequent Greek crisis much more worse. A display of correct figures from the start, could have triggered a much more rapid bailout support package already in early 2009, and if the needed structural reforms had been implemented already in the first crisis year rather than 3-6 years later - this would also have been very helpful for Greece.\n '''UK as a non-eurozone state can not be used as a 1:1 crisis-combat example to Greece:''' Of course not, this was never my point. If you want a more direct 1:1 example for other eurozone-states performing a similar \"internal devaluation\" as Greece did, then you can however compare with Estonia+Latvia+Lithuania. They actually implemented the same package of \"internal devaluation\" structural reforms and \"fiscal austerity\" in 2009, while operating a fixed euro peg. The common point for all these 3 Baltic states, was that they did all their needed tough and hurtful reforms rapidly, and subsequently also re |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5wswsVdgsZpR2l9xuvi497ZGpqL", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930406, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3810, "completion_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 3874}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 3 | Thanatos666 | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 4 | Arnoutf | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | Danish Expert | Gregarious-Extraverted |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

With common sense it is also easy to understand that a 10 mil population with >300 bn debt and a high debt/GDP ratio and >10% annual deficit has to execute a lot of hard changes to arrive again at a sustainable state.\nTo comment the measures in the debt crisis with a phrase like \"the interests of the Greek people were arguably sacrificed\" seems to be as POV as to reducing it to a sentence like \"the interests of the Eurozone tax payers have been sacrificed because Greece circumvented the Euro treaties and now wants the other people to pay for it\". But even if you prefer one-sided sources like Paul Blustein to comment or \"better understand\" the debt crisis, it does not change the way Wikipedia should describe the crisis in a summary, i.e. the main causes, main measures, and main evolvement points. So, why still block a transparent summary of the debt crisis? |\n| 10 | Thanatos666 | You fucking racist idiot, the very fact that it was only ~100bn and that had been for so long delayed and that such a huge new loan(s) was given under such conditions is the very point of it being extremely negative for the interests of Greek people, tipping the scale greatly for the interests of the creditors, even that is, if one limits oneself to a framework of a supposedly, a so called mutually agreed upon, amicable agreement and exclude a Grexit etc..Has for example the Greek debt become sustainable after and because of the program? Fuck no! It's even worse! (It's e.g. more or less the same in absolute terms and has skyrocketed in relative ones. Moreover it has been issued under English/British Law, instead of Greek Law, and is owed to the Official Sector instead of the Private one, making a much needed - and agreed upon once a primary surplus had been achieved, a taken back promise and agreement... - substantial additional haircut or even an outright default even more harmful and/or difficult to/for Greece) Have the consecutive DSAs (and assumptions thereof etc.) been reasonable or even sincere? Fuck no! (Even the supposedly achievable end-result of the program(s) would be e.g. a debt level equal to the one Greece entered the crisis with in the first place!) And so on and so forth.\nNote: the interests of the European taxpayers have indeed been sacrificed, be they Greeks only if one refers to them only, cause Greek taxpayers belong to the set of the European taxpayers, or Greeks and Germans and..., cause among things European (EZ) taxpayers in general have been lending Greece more and more, again and again, money to pay and save the German and French and Greek and... banks etc., kicking the can of the Greek insolvency further down the road and making thus things worse.Note: I won't even bother to comment on the Greek entry into the EZ. There are plenty of arguments, facts and citations available at the relevant section you have to deal with and argue against if you could...\n\nEven if common sense sided with you, which it doesn't, it very often sucks in economics, especially during macroeconomic crises; watching someone supposedly teaching ex cathedra others economics by invoking \"common sense\" is very commonly guaranteed to be ludicrous. The numbers, the conditions for example you've stated are not necessarily unsustainable by themselves for a country nor do they necessarily require the changes you're alluding to; they're missing for example the context of the debt being mostly external, for all practical purposes in a foreign currency because of the monetary union, and that they've followed a global crisis which caused a sudden stop to the capital inflows to this country (and to other countries of said monetary union); capital flows and stops/flights in a very flawed monetary union that have in fact been regarded by many scholars, economists, analysts,... as the very cause of the problem/crisis itself in the first place.That means that even if common sense dictates something true, it does not follow that it dictates what you're claiming it does.Greece for example could have unilaterally defaulted and exited the EZ and then dealt with a different set of consequences and problems. Or Germany and the rest of the surplus North could have reflated or differentially inflated in relation, with respect to the South/Periphery, making the adjustment or the austerity needed, demanded from or rather dictated to Greece and the rest of the South/Periphery, much softer, much milder. Or the austerity dictated on Greece could have been much less or much more frontloaded. Or the ECB could have dropped the rates to zero from the start and kept them constanly there since; or it could have gone for an OMT program from the beginning, including or excluding Greece to/from it.

The \"fact-based answer\" can only be \"yes\" '''\nIf an author does not arrive at an \"yes\", it would by a try to redefine history for Wikipedia.\n '''Borrower perspective''':  Greek government needed to limit spending to the fiscal income level (=\"austerity\") because Greece was not able anymore to borrow money without certain conditions attached to the borrowing contract, one condition being a certain degree of \"austerity\". Even Greece itself did not try to reduce the \"austerity\" burden with its internal fund raising possibilities like significant privatizations. Historic fact.\n '''Lender perspective''':  Neither Greek investors nor international investors/states/organizations did lend significant money to Greece without \"austerity\" conditions attached to it. Historic fact.\n '''Why not stopping irrelevant perspectives''': it would help improving the article. Ideas like \"the real purpose of the bail-out was not to save Greece but the lenders\" can not be proved as there have been 100s of Greek and international decision makers involved and if it were so, it wouldn't change the Greek debt crisis for Wikipedia, it would not change the causes, not the measures and not the evolvement of this Greek debt crisis (as those are facts); what the authors of those sentences really want to say (but somehow put it as a conspiracy) is that they don't like the fact that 100s of decision makers also tried to stabilize the banking and financial system.\n The term '''\"austerity\"''' is  a theoretical (POV) conception. It assumes that the natural state for a country is to have an automatic financing of deficits and there needs to be a political effort/action to stop this automatic source of government income. But the reality is clearly much more the contrary:  the natural state is that a government can spend its income and its reserves. To spend more it needs to keep up creditworthiness and can then decide to borrow (which typically reduces further creditworthiness). It is the same as with credit cards: if the average creditworthy citizen has one credit card and you have already three credit cards and all maxed out and lost your creditworthiness, nobody would say further banks are forcing you into anything (like austerity) because they are not providing a debt laden citizen with a fourth and fifth credit card.\nDanish Expert's reasoning on why there were no real alternatives (without \"austerity\") to Greece sounds very structured, logical, and reasonable to me, it is in line what you can read in the mainstream press, as it is based on average understanding and assumptions how economies work.  \nPOV debate\nMay be those authors having a WP:CONFLICT (conflict of interests; COI; here persons that have a special interest in Greece) should stop editing this article and stop blocking everything (COI editing is strongly discouraged in Wikipedia).

You say my request is \"ridiculous\" because you are talking about \"what the article does not say.\"  So I suppose we're agreed that what it '''does''' say currently has no POV problems; that is excellent and I am glad we can remove the tag now.  As for what it does not say, can you give specific examples of what is missing here?  That would be a good start.  Otherwise, you are just repeating yourself without specifics once again.  You are asking me to make changes to the rewrite, but there is no point in that, since we don't have any problems with the current article.  Believe me, if I get started on changing the rewrite, we have a long uphill battle ahead, as I have specific objections to nearly every sentence of it.  I have listed nine problems above with it, which you refuse to engage.  But, again, the rewrite is not necessary as we have no POV problems in the current version.  If there is something missing, let's add it!  But your mere assertion that your version is \"the only way to produce a NPOV article\" is not helpful. |\n| 10 | MONGO | Okay, now maybe this page will load a little quicker since I have archived 300 kb's of talk...sorry but this had to be done...I mean this talk page is still over 100kb's too big I'm going to look over some things tomorrow and then try to help get this article more agreeable to all involved. |\n| 11 | RonCram | Sloat, I have given specific examples.  My rewrite is full of specific examples of what the current article does not say.  But most important is the structure of the article itself, the outline.  The article has to introduce all of the different views and how they differ on the key points.  Then the body of the article has to give the evidence to support each view. How many times have I repeated this and yet you continue to ask me the same question again and again?!!!  The current article is completely POV.  Making articles NPOV is non-negotiable.  Despite your comments to the above, I did respond to your \"nine problems.\"  My version is not the final article, but it is the only way to begin an NPOV article.  An article cannot present a viewpoint as fact, as the current does.  As I said before, that is the very definition of POV.  You have never made any effort to defend the POV nature of the article. |\n| 12 | Commodore Sloat | How about putting specific examples here of what the article does not say so that we can distinguish them from the things that are also in your rewrite that are already in the article?  You keep asserting the article is completely POV but you have not yet offered a single example of a POV statement or sentence in the article.  Where does it \"present a viewpoint as fact\"?  It does not.  It states what the consensus of experts concludes.  You say you responded to the nine problems but you quickly dropped the debate when I replied to your responses, so the fact is, my arguments against your rewrite have ultimately not been refuted.

Just a thought. |\n| 2 | Commodore Sloat | I'm happy to invite others to mediate this article; in fact, both Ron and I have informally asked you to do so.  Does the process need to be formal for any reason?  Ron is making pretty blanket claims about the article being \"unsalvageable\" and so far refuses to provide specific examples or evidence.  I'm confident that once the evidence is provided we can address whatever problems exist; outside input would definitely be helpful. |\n| 3 | MONGO | I see that it could be, like forever, before a mediator is assigned due to a lack of mediators. I am always happy to help and am currently reviewing RonCrams rewrite to see what the major differences are. |\n| 4 | Commodore Sloat | Thanks - it might help (if you want more to read, lol) to look at the external_link I made against an earlier version of Ron's rewrite, which I find extremely POV and inaccurate in many places. |\n| 5 | MONGO | Okay...I'll check the references and see what I think should and shouldn't be in the article...maybe there can be some way to make everyone happy. |\n| 6 | RonCram | Gentlemen, it really makes no sense to say I have \"refused to provide specific examples or evidence.\"  I have said repeatedly that the article treats one viewpoint as fact. That is the very definition of POV.  The article does not discuss the other viewpoints on this controversial subject, nor does it say who holds these viewpoints or why. My rewrite  clarifies these essential points, yet Sloat has reverted the rewrite and been intransigent in any effort to make the article meet wikipedia standards. |\n| 7 | Commodore Sloat | You have repeated that, it is true, but you have not provided specific examples or evidence of where you believe that to be the case.  That is why it makes sense to say that.  I have not been intransigent - I have gotten frustrated, it is true, but as others here can attest, when a specific issue was named (e.g. the sentence about the various intel investigations into the issue), I worked with others to improve the sentence.  The problem, Ron, is that you have so far refused to even name a particular sentence that you think has POV problems.  Simply saying the whole thing - that has been developed over years by multiple editors from various political perspectives - should be replaced with a version that a single editor (with a single, highly charged POV) has worked on for about a month is what makes no sense. |\n| 8 | RonCram | Sloat, I am mostly talking about what the article does not say.  How can I give specific examples of that?  You are making a ridiculous request.  The article does not discuss the other viewpoints, say who holds them or why.  I cannot give you an example because the example does not exist.  I repeat what I said before - the article is POV.  I have made changes to the rewrite based on CSTAR's comments, but you will not.  Your intransigence is this regard is ridiculous.  It is my goal that we make this article into a featured article.  I am not insisting that I be the only editor of the article.  That is another ridiculous comment.  I am pointing out that my rewrite provides the best format necessary for an NPOV article.  In the Intro, it introduces the various views and the two key questions that each view needs to answer.  The body of the article discusses the evidence supporting each view.  And finally, there is a short discussion of the evidence that has been published about Saddam's possible involvement in the attacks of 9/11.  An outline of this kind is the only way to produce an NPOV article. |\n| 9 | Commodore Sloat | Please cut out the BS about my \"intransigence.\"  It is an unwarranted personal attack.  You say my request is \"ridiculous\" because you are talking about \"what the article does not say.\"  So I suppose we're agreed that what it '''does''' say currently has no POV problems; that is excellent and I am glad we can remove the tag now.

The story of the Ark antedates any Hebraic writings at all, and the fact that no one wrote down anything about it that is ''not'' in the Bible is a \"D'oh\" remark at best.  And thus ought not have weight here.  There were no \"contemporary\" writings about Troy (ca 1200 BC) - and the oral mentions by Homer (ca 750 BC) were well after the Trojan War, and placed in writing much later than that  (oldest ms. dating to 1000 AD).  The Book of Exodus dates (written) to about  600 BC,  and relates to events well before 1000 BC.  Note virtually every Biblical topic could easily have the identical caveat - amazingly enough, the Bible is the only \"source\" for the existence of hundreds of people, places and things.  Thus no \"contemporary non-biblical mentions\" exist of almost all of them entirely. |\n| 2 | Doug Weller | However, it isn't the case that there were no literate peoples at the time ascribed to the Ark or Troy. And if an academic such as Eric H. Cline saw it worthwhile mentioning I can't see why we should take your opinion over his. His lectures on the Trojan war are worth listening to, by the way. I think it's also relevant here because it is still something that people are searching for. |\n| 3 | Collect | How many were able to read and write - and how many ''written historical accounts'' date from 1000 BC or so?  \"Literate\" means \"able to read and write\" ... the Hebrew alphabet was only around from circa 1000 BC ... and was certainly not in common usage at the time of Moses .   I suppose Moses ''might'' have been literate in Babylonian cuneiform , but that does not matter here.  What does count is that on page 131 of the NatGeo article, the author states \"''In fact, the ark is mentioned in only a few extra-biblical sources\"   which is not that same as \"mo contemporary extra-biblical references\" which was not a major claim made by Cline ... Cline was dealing in an article about \"''possible locations of the ark''\" and not making major pronouncements about references existing in a pre-literate period at all. Using an article in NatGeo specifically speculating on ''possible locations of the \"lost ark\"''  to make a claim ''not intrinsic to the nature of the article'' is wrong. |\n| 4 | PiCo | I wonder what non-biblical sources Cline is talking about? 2 Maccabees? the Talmud?

The claim as worded in the article here suggests that it might be fictitious, which is ''not'' what Cline states.   It is as \"scholarly\" as any work written by a scholar for the popular market is - it can not be rationally used for an en passant claim which is ''not'' a major claim in the book - which is about possible locations for the Ark today.  Asimov was a \"scholar\" but that does not mean we use his every en passant claim as being \"scholarly.\"   Cline was writing to suggest that the Babylonians etc. did not view the Ark as a lootable treasure.   The book qua book is ''not'' about the Ark - in fact it is covered in only a short chapter in the book - with each chapter written to \"stand alone\".  Cline, in fact, states that the neo-Babylonians were more likely to have destroyed it than to consider it as treasure, which suggest that he specifically considers the biblical references as sufficient to establish that the Ark did exist at one point, and he notes the non-mentions of David and Solomon by others did not make them non-existent  (page 186) - and recent archeological finds are noted by Cline to show that they did exist.   Did you read the ''entirety'' of the chapter about the Ark?   We could possibly say \"''mention of the Ark is not found in the records of societies which might have looted the temple\"'' as that is the actual import of Cline's claims. On page 136, Cline states the description of the Ark closely resembles actual artifacts found in the Near East, and  that's its existence would be in line with other societies of the same general period there.  I would note  that there are no \"contemporary non-Egyptian records of King Tut\" is also proper.  So again I suggest that what Cline states in that chapter is reasonably presented as \"''mention of the Ark is not found in the records of societies which might have looted the temple.\"'' |\n| 7 | Collect | Anent my use of \"popular\" - if one demurs one might note what Google books states: ''Eric H. Cline holds degrees in classical archaeology, Near Eastern archaeology, and ancient history, and currently serves as chair of the Department of Classical and Semitic Languages and Literatures at George Washington University. A prolific researcher and the prize-winning author of seven books, including The Battles of Armageddon: Megiddo and the Jezreel Valley from the Bronze Age to the Nuclear Age, which won a Biblical Archaeology Society Publication Award for \"Best Popular Book on Archaeology\" and was a Main Selection of the Natural Science Book Club. He lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.''\nClines books are \"popular\" in nature.  Recall Cline also wrote \"Raiders of the Faux Ark\" (Boston Globe)   which is, indeed, a \"popular\" piece and not a \"scholarly work\" as one finds in OUP publications and peer-reviewed sources.  Distinctions are clear. |\n| 8 | Doug Weller | iIf you tpreally want to argue that at RSN go ahead, my quotes show other scholars take the book more seriously than you do.

Plumcouch,\nUseage of the word ''Remake'' while referring Salaam E Ishq in relation to Love Actually is highly objectionable.\n''Supposing'' the film is a pure remake, is like supposing Love Actually's script being stolen from Nikhil Advani's personal Diary.\nNone is the case here. The film is best defined as- loosely inspired by Love Actually.\nreference- Nikhil Advani's Interviews on India FM-http://www.salmankhan.net/forthcoming/salam-e-isq.asp\nFollowing are some Excerpts from the Interviews-\nNikhil Advani's Interview about Salaam-E-Ishq\nBy IndiaFM News Bureau, July 8, 2006 - 02:48 IST\nQ: Can you tell us a bit about the story?\nA: Well as the title suggests it is a tribute to love, it revolves\naround several couples and their love stories.\nQ: Is it inspired from \"Love Actually\".\nA: Yes, Actually.\nSalaam E Ishq\nIndu Mirani\nSaturday, April 15, 2006 21:46 IST\nQ: Is Salaam-e-Ishq based on Love Actually?\nA: It\u2019s not possible to pick up a Hollywood film and just copy it simply because western narratives take a lot of things for granted. Like you make a guy wear a suit, carry a briefcase, make him walk down Wall Street and you know he\u2019s a banker. In Hindi cinema the background has to be established.Saurabh Shukla, Suresh Nair and I thought about the six great relationship stories we know. We then chose the six most interesting, that\u2019s how the film was conceived.\n\nThe inclusion of a Picture by a fellow Wiki' Editor from Salaam E Ishq is as fair as using\nThe Main ''Old'' picture taken From Lucky, No Time For Love which was released in 2005,\nLabelling the film as a remake for including a picture by someone else is not justified.\nA remake is defined as a new version of a previously made Movie. Usually a shot for shot recreation in the same language and by the same film Industry.\nFor Example Oceans Eleven 1960's remake in 2001,\nPsycho 1960's remake in 1998 -English-Same Language/ -Hollywood- Same Industry.\nDefinition of Remake cited-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remake\nWhile an Adaptation is a Movie which has been Loosely inspired from the original with quite a few changes, like Language for instance, as well as other changes like the Main plot.\nFor example Bollywood's Omkara which is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play Othello.\nAkira Kuruaswa's Ran which was based on Shakespeare's King Lear.\nWhile his own Seven Samurai inspired Ramesh Sippy's Sholay and RajKumar Santoshi's China Gate\nwhich had similar plots.\nDefinition of Adaptation cited here-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation\nRemakes are usually done with permission of the Production company/Producers\nthat hold the rights of the Original.\nA remake is considered an inferior copy of the Original by the viewers, hence labelling the film as a remake prior to its release is a serious allegation which can be viewed as an attempt to defame not only the Film but also all those who are associated to it.\nIf you have concrete proof that it is a scene by scene dialogue by dialogue copy of the Original,\nthen not only will I withdraw my protest, but also the producers of Salaam E Ishq might hear\na word of protest from the producers of Love Actually.\nTill then, calling the film an inspiration (proof cited) will only be fair.\nFree rights should not be exercised to malign someone by twisting the truth.\nThanks,\nBest regards,\nSlytime. |\n| 2 | Plumcouch | Hi, Slytime,\nyou're definitions about remake and adaptation are absolutely correct. I added as much info as I could on Salaam-E-Ishq to justify the fair-use of Khan's SEI-pic (I don't care if it's a remake or an inspiration - we'll see that when the movie comes out; and I don't give too much about what directors say about their inspirations - see Sanjay Gupta's latest Zinda (film) and it's comparison to Old Boy.) As for the Lucky-pic: I'm still trying to find some info on the movie (besides the mention of it's existence), so we can keep that pic too (as it shows Khan more or less how he currently looks). Maybe it would be nice to have a pic of Khan when he was young and just about to start his career - like we have in Farida Jalal's article. Best regards, |\n| 3 | 59.178.22.176 | Hi! Plumcouch,\nMaybe you don't care whether the movie is a remake or an adaptation, but readers worldwide, who refer Wikipedia as a knowledgable and reliable source, do.\nThere is a lot of difference between their meanings as much as between make and break.\nSanjay Gupta's work cannot be compared and referred to Nikhil Advani's work as they are both different individuals and so has been their work.\nThe contribution of the Editor who included SEI's pic is as much valued and appreciated as your contribution of the L'NTFL picture.\nHowever, the latest pic stands more relevance to the readers vis-a-vis present times, irrespective of the Star's looks which have only gotten better with the passage of Time.\nThanks,\nBest Wishes,\nSlytime. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5xaw4iXTH8Qz8EqRionUGczxVT3", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930450, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3786, "completion_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 3854}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 59.178.22.176 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Plumcouch | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 3 | 59.178.22.176 | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

Best regards, |\n| 5 | 59.178.19.64 | Hello! Plumcouch,\nI fully understand your point of view. However, at present there is no reason for us to distrust Nikhil Advani's words simply for the fact that Sanjay Gupta is ''Such a good filmmaker''.\nBut in order to stay neutral, since Salaam E Ishq is yet unreleased, we'll have to give some  credibilty to Mr. Advani's statement.\nFor instance prior to his maiden release, Kal Ho Na Ho was speculated to be a remake of Anand-(1970).\nOn release, It turned out to be an Original effort as claimed by the Director.\nTherefore, as for now, one can safely go by Mr. Advani's word as the most reliable source, rather than other speculations.\nAs for the Photographs, I personally have no issues with either of them.\nAt the time of your contribution, it was probably the best available original, so both are equally good efforts. With limited availibilty, They seem to be the best as yet.\nSalman Khan is rated as the most good looking actor even without hair, so it doesn't make any difference, shaven pate or not.\nOne, from his early days will certainly add nostalgic value, ie. from Biwi Ho to Aisi or Maine Pyar Kiya days.\nEverything will be fine as far as you correctly pointed out, the resolution is good.\nIn case, you were looking for some info on Lucky-NTFL.\nAlow me to share some info, in case you missed it-\nResults- about 57,800,000 for Lucky no time for love. (0.38 seconds) on Google.\nThe movie is still popular amongst youngsters as Sneha Ullal has become a household name in India.\nIt was nominated for the Best Music category at the Annual Filmfare awards 2006.\nMusic- Adnan Sami.\nPlanet Bollywood rated it as one of the best Music albums released in 2005, with several chart bursting numbers.\nDespite its modest success at home, The movie did an outstanding business overseas-\nInfact, both the Salman starrers 'Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya' and 'Lucky-No Time for Love' have fetched one of the best collections in UK (2005)for a Bollywood film in the opening weekend. While 'Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya' earned 148,298 British pounds (nearly Rs 1.2 crore) in its opening weekend from just 35 screens, 'Lucky' earned 122,913 Pounds in its opening weekend from just 29 screens with a per screen average of 4,238 Pounds, which was better than the performance by films like Vipul Shah 's Waqt \u2013 A Race Against Time , Karan Johar 's Kaal , Yash Chopra \u2018s Bunty Aur Babli , Vidhu Vinod Chopra 's Parineeta , Shah Rukh Khan 's Paheli and the Sanjay Dutt - Shilpa Shetty starrer Dus .\nAt home it ranks as the 27th all time Best Opening Film (first 7 days) at the box office-\nLucky No Time For Love- 09 Apr 2005- 382 cinemas- Net Gross-10,21,00,000-\nFurther, one can find references of the movie's existence also at-\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky:_No_Time_for_Love\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449306/\nhttp://www.indiafm.com/movies/cast/7295/index.html\nhttp://www.planetbollywood.com/Music/Lucky-NoTimeForLove/\nhttp://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20050728-0.html\nhttp://boxofficeindia.com/openingweek.htm\nMeanwhile, I shall also, look out for some good resolution pictures.\nThanks,\nBest regards,\nSlytime. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5xlwOWAnzSAsgmXINcI9TFlfNZw", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930461, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3743, "completion_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 3792}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Plumcouch | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | 59.178.19.64 | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

However, at present there is no reason for us to distrust Nikhil Advani's words simply for the fact that Sanjay Gupta is ''Such a good filmmaker''.\nBut in order to stay neutral, since Salaam E Ishq is yet unreleased, we'll have to give some  credibilty to Mr. Advani's statement.\nFor instance prior to his maiden release, Kal Ho Na Ho was speculated to be a remake of Anand-(1970).\nOn release, It turned out to be an Original effort as claimed by the Director.\nTherefore, as for now, one can safely go by Mr. Advani's word as the most reliable source, rather than other speculations.\nAs for the Photographs, I personally have no issues with either of them.\nAt the time of your contribution, it was probably the best available original, so both are equally good efforts. With limited availibilty, They seem to be the best as yet.\nSalman Khan is rated as the most good looking actor even without hair, so it doesn't make any difference, shaven pate or not.\nOne, from his early days will certainly add nostalgic value, ie. from Biwi Ho to Aisi or Maine Pyar Kiya days.\nEverything will be fine as far as you correctly pointed out, the resolution is good.\nIn case, you were looking for some info on Lucky-NTFL.\nAlow me to share some info, in case you missed it-\nResults- about 57,800,000 for Lucky no time for love. (0.38 seconds) on Google.\nThe movie is still popular amongst youngsters as Sneha Ullal has become a household name in India.\nIt was nominated for the Best Music category at the Annual Filmfare awards 2006.\nMusic- Adnan Sami.\nPlanet Bollywood rated it as one of the best Music albums released in 2005, with several chart bursting numbers.\nDespite its modest success at home, The movie did an outstanding business overseas-\nInfact, both the Salman starrers 'Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya' and 'Lucky-No Time for Love' have fetched one of the best collections in UK (2005)for a Bollywood film in the opening weekend. While 'Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya' earned 148,298 British pounds (nearly Rs 1.2 crore) in its opening weekend from just 35 screens, 'Lucky' earned 122,913 Pounds in its opening weekend from just 29 screens with a per screen average of 4,238 Pounds, which was better than the performance by films like Vipul Shah 's Waqt \u2013 A Race Against Time , Karan Johar 's Kaal , Yash Chopra \u2018s Bunty Aur Babli , Vidhu Vinod Chopra 's Parineeta , Shah Rukh Khan 's Paheli and the Sanjay Dutt - Shilpa Shetty starrer Dus .\nAt home it ranks as the 27th all time Best Opening Film (first 7 days) at the box office-\nLucky No Time For Love- 09 Apr 2005- 382 cinemas- Net Gross-10,21,00,000-\nFurther, one can find references of the movie's existence also at-\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky:_No_Time_for_Love\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449306/\nhttp://www.indiafm.com/movies/cast/7295/index.html\nhttp://www.planetbollywood.com/Music/Lucky-NoTimeForLove/\nhttp://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20050728-0.html\nhttp://boxofficeindia.com/openingweek.htm\nMeanwhile, I shall also, look out for some good resolution pictures.\nThanks,\nBest regards,\nSlytime. |\n| 6 | Plumcouch | Hi, there, Slytime,\nall right, I'll incorporate bits of the information you provided on Lucky in order to justify the fair use of Khan's first pic. As for Khan's \"bald\" status - just thought it might be interesting to show the \"phases\" he went through - or the different looks, but the article isn't really long, so I guess two pictures are the most we can add.\nAbout Nikhil Advani: you're right, there's no reason to distrust his work, but I'm kinda careful when it comes to director statements, especially because of Sanjay Gupta. I think, if directors steal an entire movie, it gives their entire industry a bad name and Bollywood produces such great movies, and yet, in the Western hemisphere (where I live), it is almost always associated with \"Oh, the guys that steal entire movies, insert some songs and call them Indian.\" and I think that's kinda sad - so sorry for the overly pessimistic attitude towards Nikhil Advani.\nAgain, thanks a ton for Lucky-info. Best regards,  \nPS. BTW, Sneha Ullal is a household name in India? Any new movies for her? I liked her quite a bit, but couldn't find any info on her future projects (if they even exist).

Do you know anything? |\n| 7 | 59.178.29.182 | Hi! there Plumcouch,\nAbsolutely no need to apologise mate. The thought alone counted.\nThere was no ill will but an opinion which was formed due to set precedents.\nI am hopeful that SEI will stand on its own merit, we will have to wait and see.\nI'm sure Nikhil Advani won't let the expectations down, he comes with a tag of a Highly Talented Individual. With Kal Ho Na Ho he has established a reputaion for himself which will be tested for sure.\nAbout Sneha Ullal, she certainly holds a lot of promise.\nI noticed your contributions to her page, it's good work, keep it up.\nThe Movie Lucky-NTFL had generated a lot of Interest amongst the younger generation, who were keen to see this young girl paired up with Salman. There were reports that she resembled Aishwarya Rai a lot, though Salman believes she resembles yesteryears actress Nadira (Farhat Ezekeil Nadira) more, which is a flattering compliment considering Nadira's beauty.\nSee- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadira_(actress)\nYou'll find more pictures of Late actress Nadira at google, which throws more perspective on their resemblence.\nA brief background-\nWhile Salman's home production was searching for a suitable cast, since the role required a young girl, Arpita- Salman's little sis discovered Sneha near her college.\nThe resemblence to Aishwarya Rai was striking thanks to light eyes and fair skin, though individually Sneha has held out on her own now.\nIncidentally Aishwarya Rai was also said to be a Lisa Ray look alike in her early modelling days due to the same reason. (light eyes, fair skin)\nAlso John Abraham was considered a Marc Robinson lookalike during old times.\nRishi Kapoors daughter Riddhima Kapoor, who's happily married now and is a loyal fan of Salman, was Salman's first choice for the role, however, Ridhhima never wanted a Film career, so she had to turn down the offer.\nThe resemblence to Aishwarya was incidental and was picked up by the press to create enough hype prior to its release. The film was marketed very well by T-series.\nThe highlights were, Salman giving a chance to Debut Directors, Vinay Rao and Radhika Sapru who had only made a video with Salman before, Honey-Honey. People say Salman doesn't plan his career, today they say Lucky-NTFL wasn't a biggie of Salman, but they forget Salman valued their potential more than anything.\nThe film was eagerly awaited since Sneha was kept well under wraps, people wanted to judge for themselves, how close the resemblence was. Today there's hardly anyone in the country(India) who doesn't know Sneha Ullal. The movie met modest success and has been viewed on Television by all of those who missed it on the theatres, plus the chart topping music videos also played their hand in providing great visibilty to Sneha. Hence she has become a household name and is instantly recognised by all.\nShe's been careful of picking meaningful roles so she hasn't signed films by the dozen.\nPost Aryan, she's doing another Movie called ''Kaash Aap Hote''\ncitation- http://www.bollyvista.com/article/a/32/6908\nWe hope to see more of her evolution as she's only 19 yet, and as she has a lot of growing up to do, to catch up with Ash and Nadira in terms of age, it will be interesting to see the metamorphosis of comingup resemblences in the process. (The press certainly has their work cut out)\nThere is no doubt she'll make her own mark.\nAny individual that resembles Nadira and Aishwarya is blessed nevertheless.\nWith Aryan she will come to be known of her own, she is indeed an awesome find.\nBest regards,\nSlytime. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5xyKyYWZrFLeiyemFEMHAQmozT5", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930474, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3720, "completion_tokens": 49, "total_tokens": 3769}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | Plumcouch | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 7 | 59.178.29.182 | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

You can read right in there how he says all those lands were legally his because the occupants had no right to hold them, and he claimed them as up for grabs and his for the taking.  This proclamation is what all of the jingoistic 'Virginia extended to the pacific and to the ohio' attitude or pov that permeates this article, finds its basis and justification in, barbaric as it might seem in modern times, to continue claiming all these areas where no Englishmen actually ever set foot were legally Virginia \"on paper\" because King James decided the nations already there had no claim. |\n| 2 | MPS | Anyone interested in the Charter of 1606 can find it on the internet here.  Under the English feudal system, lands of non-Christians were considered to not have legitimate governments and thus they were not sovereign states subject to Act of State doctrine. According to the political philosophy of the day, once the king claimed land for his kingdom, divine right of kings gave James I divine authority to establish the law over that land... hence the Virginia Charter. Not saying it was morally right, but legally it \"was the way it was\" until the Tenures Abolition Act of 1660. So really, the disenfranchisement of indigenous rights was a function of the post-reformational intellectual climate. Do we want to say this or do we just assume that people know that early Virginia history is a product of the Jacobean era? Peace, |\n| 3 | TheVirginiaHistorian | Why yes, the article refers to the founding of Jamestown named for the James I of the Jacobean Era; the colonization attempt of Elizabeth I had failed at Roanoke. But what would you change in the article account of the French and Indian War?  \nDear IP.222, In the late 1500s, Powhatan increased the empire of his father during his lifetime something like ten-fold, including territorial expansion west, north and east to the Chesapeake Bay. The English were just another group which took the contested lands from the most recent Amerindian conqueror who had  in his turn  governed before them by right of conquest without the free consent of the previous occupants. Even with the cessions to the English, Powhatan continued to expand his empire of tributary tribes, and set himself up as a trading middleman between the English and tribes more removed from Jamestown. Sometimes in this matter of right-by-conquest, writers stake out a race-based bias which does not comprehend both cultural sides in an even handed way.\nThe firsthand source of a 1606 \"charter granting all of those occupied territories\" does not bear on the historic facts discussed in reliable scholarly sources that most Native-American tribes along the Virginia western frontier sided with the French as military allies in the French and Indian War of the mid 1700s, - and they suffered the fate of defeated nations that violate peace treaties when initiating conflict  loss of territory to accommodate the victors, sometimes with payment of restitution or tribute, thus assuring their self preservation.\nInterestingly, some Eastern Woodland Indian land cessions were accompanied by the \"winning\" English or French making sustained payments to tribes over decades, including treasure, technological innovations such as copper pots, firearm weapons and blacksmiths to maintain them, - firearms which the Amerindians used in combat against their Virginian treaty partners by 1644, due in part to the expanded arms supply by New Amsterdam's Dutch (later absorbed into New York) at the time of Anglo-Dutch wars. |\n| 4 | 71.127.128.222 | 1644 eh, so in other words you are alleging that Opechancanough got firearms from the Dutch? That's a new one on me. |\n| 5 | TheVirginiaHistorian | Yeah, I think that's in Andrews 1937 \"Virginia: the Old Dominion\". He maintains Algonquin language tribes traded with one another along the eastern seaboard. The Virginians were pretty good about trying to keep firearms out of the hands of Amerindians by law. Opechancanough wanted a war-chief reputation comparable to his brother's early career, so pulled off quite a tactical surprise considering his armament and the existing treaties of Powhatan as a peace-chief. He killed more English, but with less effect. Powhatan's assault twenty years before finished off the Virginia Company and made Virginia a royal colony. The English counter-punch \"march\" to Opechancanough resulted in the Powhatans ceding some eastern territory to the Fall Line.\nThough as a source for Wikipedia, I prefer Heinemann out of the University of Virginia 2007 \"Old Dominion, New Commonwealth\" for political history, or alternatively Wallenstein out of Virginia Tech 2007 \"Cradle of America: four centuries of Virginia History\" and Dabney's 1972 \"Virginia: the New Dominion\" for minority history.

What are your favorite reliable, scholarly published sources for contributions to Wikipedia on Virginia? |\n| 6 | 71.127.128.222 | Haha, what all the modern reliable sources say is the natives in VA mostly got their firearms between the years 1656 and 1676, when the House of Burgesses apparently tolerated a group of kidnappers from the great lakes known as the Westo in exchange for English muskets. The real problem here is too many reliable sources from professionals talking about this in detail to quote, but just a couple I found that seem good and recent:\nCynthia A. Kierner, \u200eSandra Gioia Treadway - 2015 - ''Virginia Women: Their Lives and Times'' Volume 1 - Page 40\nAllan Gallay, 2009, ''Indian Slavery in Colonial America'' p. 217, and 2002, ''The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South'' p. 41\n Eric E Bowne 2005 ''The Westo Indians: Slave Traders of the Early Colonial South''\nRegards, |\n| 7 | TheVirginiaHistorian | Sorry, wrong on all counts.\nPage 40 of Kierner\u2019s book concerns Grace Sherwood (c. 1660 \u2013 c. 1740), \u201cThe Virginia Witch\u201d. It does not address the armament of Opecancanough in 1644 twenty years before her birth, nor the French and Indian War alliances fifteen years after her death.   \"haha, what all the modern reliable sources say\"  are there no sources to support your point of view at all? It may be we can help you here with chronology, as sequence of events matters in historiography.\nPage 217 of Gallay\u2019s book Indian Slavery concerns Indian slavery in Southeastern Indian and British Societies, 1670-1730, which does not address either Opencancanough\u2019s armament in the assault of 1644, nor the French and Indian War under discussion. The Westos traded with Virginia colonists \"exchanging war captives for guns\" and \u201cterrorizing Indians throughout the southeast with their slave raids.\u201d \u2014 not attacking British colonists with firearms as Opecancanough did. In the early 1660s, the Westos moved out of the region of Virginia into the Carolinas, almost a hundred years prior to the French and Indian war under discussion (1754\u20131763). \npage 41 of  Gallay\u2019s The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South is about Carolina, the Westo, and the Trade in Indian Slaves, 1670-1685, not in Virginia and after the French and Indian War. \nBowne\u2019s \u201cThe Westo Indians: Slave Traders of the Early Colonial South\u201d notes, \"At the height of their influence, between 1659 and 1680, it is believed the Westos captured and sold several thousand Indians from Spanish Florida, often trading them for guns.\u201d The Westos were effective fighters until Native Americans banded together in confederacies and obtained their own fire arms from friendly Europeans to resist them. The Westos did not arm Native American tribes to assault the colonists. This does not reflect on how Powhatans gained firearms between 1622 and 1644. It is also irrelevant to a narrative concerning Native-American alliances with the French against the English colonies in the French and Indian War.\nThat is, you still have no sources to support removing the contested passage on \"most Native-American tribes on Virginia's frontier\" joined with the French in a military alliance during the French and Indian War (Seven Year's War). |\n| 8 | 71.127.128.222 | Not a damn thing I said was wrong, actually.   Dont expect me to play by some silly rules you dictate on what my source should refer to.  I never said I was offering those sources as mentioning anything about Opechancanough or 1644. I specifically said that they all agree (which they do) that the Westo traded kidnapped Indian children to Virginians in exchange for firearms after 1656 (I don't suppose you think that bears mention in history of Virginia do you?) From what I know of 1644, the Powhatan had not obtained many firearms by then though I admit I could be wrong there, I wasn't looking for a source on that yet. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5yB8tDJ6Ci1EmAvrcNoZTTZ6kIZ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930487, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3779, "completion_tokens": 89, "total_tokens": 3868}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | TheVirginiaHistorian | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 6 | 71.127.128.222 | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 7 | TheVirginiaHistorian | Assured-Dominant |\n| 8 | 71.127.128.222 | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

The usage I see nowadays is more that a blockchain database is the more general case, and the specific bitcoin protocol is just one (perhaps, the first?) instance of a block chain database protocol.\nMy answer: According to reliable sources, the newest block chain designs are based on the original bitcoin concept and/or code published by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a misunderstanding to think that because they add new functionality to the original concept, they are not based on it. |\n| 2 | N2e | I appreciate you directly addressing the matter here on the talk page.  But I take some exception with the edit comment relative to the change you removed (which I had made) to the article.  Also, I did not actually add the text to the lede section in the way you asserted, I added a hidden comment, to try to gain clarification, and to invite discussion.\nI added the following ''hidden comment'' to the lede sentence, shown in '''bold''' text below to make it easier for all to see my addition.  Note that, since the question I asked was a hidden comment, readers of the encyclopedia would not see the question, they would see only the  tag I added, no prose was changed in what the reader could see, except for the tag asking that the prose be clarified. It still needs clarified.\nA block chain or blockchain is a distributed database, based on the bitcoin protocol,'''{{clarify|date=March 2016}}''' that maintains a continuously growing list of data records hardened against tampering and revision, even by its operators.\nIn my view, that prose still needs to be clarified ''in the lede sentence'', or if the claim \"based on the bitcoin protocol\" is always and forever true, for all blockchain databases that could be conceived of in the way the term is ordinarily used in computer science, then it needs a citation that supports the claim.\nFor example, if it is the case, and I do not know that it is (that's why I asked the question), that all blockchain databases are \"based on the bitcoin protocol\", even then, the statement in the prose could be improved for clarity to the global audience who reads this article.  For example, it could become \"A block chain or blockchain is a distributed database, derived from the original bitcoin protocol of 2008, ...\", or, \"A block chain or blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records hardened against tampering and revision, even by its operators.  All blockchain databases today are derived from the original bitcoin protocol of 2008.\"  Either one would be clearer than what the prose in the first sentence of the lede reads today.\nSo the sentence still needs clarified for readers.  Cheers. |\n| 3 | Ladislav Mecir | \"if the claim ... is always and forever true\" - I do neither think that sources claim that anything is \"forever true\", nor do I see such a claim in the article. The references present in the article confirm that the (newer or older) block chain designs are based on the original bitcoin concept and/or code published by Satoshi Nakamoto. That is the essence. To your proposed changes of the text: \"derived from the original bitcoin protocol of 2008\" - I do not see any clarification. The text just adds a year that does not look necessary, especially it does not clarify whether anything may be \"forever true\". What can be found in the existing sources is that, as opposed to the white paper published in 2008, bitcoin code is open source for anybody to see, copy, and derive from, originally published in 2009 and that the code is still evolving. |\n| 4 | N2e | Let me say this a different way.  First off, I used the words \"always and forever true\" to illustrate that the the statement in the current lede sentence is a strong statement (\"A block chain or blockchain is a distributed database, based on the bitcoin protocol, ...\".  It is a broad statement that the scope of this article, which is about this thing called a blockchain database, \"is based on the bitcoin protocol\".  The statement itself thus does not allow for blockchain databases that might be based on any other protocol.  That seems a bit limiting to the more general concept of what a blockchain is, and would make this article really about \"bitcoin protocol derived blockchains\" rather than blockchains more generally.  I think that is a mistake, and this article ought to be about blockchains more generally.\nI'm going to step away from this discussion for a few days to allow other voices to enter the discussion.  Don't think it will be helpful to have just the two of us discussing, and potentially talking past each other.  Cheers. |\n| 5 | Sanpitch | No one disputes that idea of a blockchain was introduced by Bitcoin.  But the words 'based on bitcoin' could either mean this idea of the blockchain being introduced by Bitcoin (definitely true), or it could mean that the source code is explicitly based on one of the many codebases of Bitcoin source code (not always true). I changed the lede to say that Blockchain was 'introduced by Bitcoin'. |\n| 6 | Ladislav Mecir | '''Disagree''' Your idea that block chain is not based on bitcoin protocol contradicts the available sources.

I restored this part of the article asking Dr.K. to raise any specific objections he might have to the talk page before removing sourced content. I also added an estimation of the number of Pontic Greek casualties between 1916-1923 based on an article published in the scholarly journal ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' concurring with that of Kostopoulos.  A short while later Athenean removed both the content sourced with references to Kostopoulos's book and the one referring to the ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies''. His edit summary reads: \"WP:FRINGE Greek leftist sources that contradict mainstream scholarship\".\nTo call the ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' a \"leftist source\" is merely ludicrous and I will not deal with that. Regarding Kostopoulos: Athenean's claim betrays a confusion of two different levels of being on the \"fringe\". A scholar's political affiliation might not be very popular, but this does not place his or her scholarly views on the scholarly fringe. On the contrary, what might be a fringe opinion among politicians or within a certain society is not necessarily a fringe opinion in either the international or local scholarly community. A Turkish scholar regarding the Armenian Genocide a genocide is in the fringe with reference to the predominant view among Turks but not so with regards to the international consensus of historians. Similarly, Kostopoulos's views on the matter are shared by, among others, Columbia university Professor of History Mark Mazower and the leading living authority on the Armenican genocide, Taner Akcam. These are simply not fringe figures of the global historical community.\nA Google search would suffice to demonstrate that Kostopoulos's ''Polemos kai ethnokatharse'', along with his other writings, is recognized as belonging in the \"mainstream\" as it is regularly being used as a reference work for the issues it discusses by contemporary mainstream scholarship  see, for example, |\n| 2 | Dr.K. | The Kostopulos book is clearly controversial. According to this source for example, the book thesis is that it \"presents the Greeks overall as criminals and all the other people in the area   as victims of the Greeks\" while this source on the left is praising it as debunking the mythology of the state ideological mechanisms. The controversies presented in this book have not been accepted by mainstream academic critics. That it was published in the ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' doesn't mean that the entire thesis of the author has been accepted as fact. Also, according to Research Gate the impact factor of the journal is currently zero meaning that this publication has no current academic impact let alone any standing in specialist historiography dealing with genocides. Much more critical acceptance by mainstream genocide scholar historians is needed before the controversial facts presented by the author are fit to be showcased in this article. Until such time as it is accepted by mainstream academics, presenting these views in the article is WP:UNDUE and WP:POV. Your edit-warring to add this POV to the article should cease because it has become disruptive. |\n| 3 | Ashmedai 119 | First, it would be wrong to treat the impact factor appearing on ResearchGate.net as the sole or even a valid criterion for a journal's impact and deduce that the ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' has \"no current academic impact\". The site's impact factor calculator is obviously problematic when it comes to a number of historical journals. See, for example, the resutls it provides for journals such as Modern Intellectual History (pubished by Cambridge UP), Journal of the History of Ideas (published by University of Pennsylvania Press), Holocaust and Genocide Studies (published by Oxford UP) or Journal of Genocide Reseach, all (!) of which falsely appear to have zero impact  incidentally, the last two are currently being used in the article. If one were to form a sound opinion on the impact of the ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'', it would be advisable to consult other, more credible indexes  such as Scimago, in which JMGS appears to be faring not bad at all for an over-specialized scientific journal restricting itself to only one period of one small nation's history.\nSecond, the \"sources\" you link to [one of the two titled \"Blasphemy against the fatherland\" (sic)] are both pieces of *political* criticism, written by persons stating absolutely no scholarly or historical qualifications and published in either a \"political\" journal and a blog. They do not matter at all in the process of determining the scholarly value of Kostopoulos's book. What should be taken into account, per WP:RS, is not if the book is \"controversial\" from a political point of view, but whether the book \"has been vetted by the scholarly community [and] is regarded as reliable\". As demonstrated above, Kostopoulos's study is not only regarded a reliable historical study, but it has received laudatory comments from academics and in scientific journals, where it is presented as a fine piece of scholarship and deemed \"successful\" particularly in showing that the \"genocide\" is more accurately described as \"ethnic cleansing\". Kostopoulos is, thus, regarded by his peers himself as a specialist when it comes (among other historical matters) to the case of the persecution of Ottoman Greeks in the 1910s and '20s, as evidenced by their approval in reviews and their |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5yTuiHrMD8hIdRHQ6PJqxZPQJNy", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930505, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3810, "completion_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 3872}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ashmedai 119 | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Dr.K. | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 3 | Ashmedai 119 | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

However, while I concur that the removal of sourced information without due justification is unacceptable, I do call upon Ashmedai 119 to refrain from any further reverts at this point and do agree that the previous ones were rather unconstructive.\nI am rather ignorant on the topic of Greek historiography. However, a careful look as an outsider reveals that this book has been praised by at least two highly reputable scholars and has been cited numerous times in books published by highly reputable publishing houses such as Edinburgh University Press and Routledge. On the other hand, the author of the Nea Politiki article has not been cited and I cannot find any English-language resources on which I can assess the journal. As such, we have a critical review whose impact I cannot establish as an outsider (this is not to say it should be disregarded). That a left wing page praises Kostopoulos is irrelevant, pretty much the same as a right wing page that may praise any author here; it has no scholarly weight. This, if I can daresay, gives me the view that this book is indeed accepted as mainstream historiography with some isolated criticism. Dr.K. has not made any real case to counter Ashmedai's evidence or that Kostopoulos' views are actually ''rejected'' by mainstream academics, and unless a level of rejection encountered by denalists such as Lowry and McCarthy is established, a removal is not appropriate. At worst, his views should be presented in the way we currently present Horton's work, which remains in the article despite scathing criticism from very eminent scholars.\nThe argument from the impact factor and \"acceptance of views\" is rather puzzling. This article makes extensive use of primary sources, an unpublished master's thesis and other journals whose impact factors are zero according to ResearchGate (Journal of Genocide Research, used to convey a crucial view by Schaller and Zimmerer that there is obvious genocidal quality here, Genocide Studies and Prevention) to make significant claims. The impact and the reception of the work of other scholars in the same section, e.g. Hatzidimitriou, who arrives at a very high figure, has never been examined, and Hatzidimitriou's assertion has not even been peer reviewed. This of course does not invalidate Dr.K.'s point, there is obviously a lot of merit in this argument, but this implies that a major re-examination of the article is necessary and that quite a lot of removal is due, and it is puzzling to see that this evaluation has not been extended to other zero-impact journals in the past.\n\"That it was published in the Journal of Modern Greek Studies doesn't mean that the entire thesis of the author has been accepted as fact\" is also a curious argument. Strictly speaking true, but the same can be said about Jones' (who is not even an expert on the period's history in the region) astronomical estimate of 750,000, which is not supported by any other scholar in this field or by any substantial calculation/evidence. Let alone the fact that a substantial portion of the article is based on primary sources, let alone peer reviewed journals of Johns Hopkins University. And again, no argument has been made to show that there is a substantial, non-isolated non-acceptance of this view, contrary to evidence for acceptance. Voutira's estimate, being at least peer-reviewed, is actually much more acceptable than others in the section. Personal skepticism alone is not grounds for removal.\nApologies for the bulkiness of this comment, and apologies in advance if I have erred in any of my statements/inferences. |\n| 5 | Macrakis | This is obviously a highly charged and political topic, where it is difficult to get a dispassionate, scholarly approach.\nWhat's more, none of the contemporary (primary) sources can be read at face value: the Ottoman ones (Talat Pasha) are full of evasions and euphemisms; the European ones are often reflexively sympathetic to the Christians and hostile to the Ottomans both for cultural and for geopolitical reasons; and of course the Greek politicians and bureaucrats of the time have their own mentality coloring their writing. So it is important to have a critical eye; and Kostopoulos seems to have that. Beyond that, all the countries in the region have, over time, created a narrative for themselves extolling their own history, a narrative that is widely distributed in schoolbooks and popular literature. Contradicting that narrative is bound to cause controversy.\nNow, I haven't read Kostopoulos, and have only skimmed some of the criticisms mentioned here, but it is clear that many of the attacks on him are because the reviewers don't like his conclusions. I also saw the edit comment which wants to remove him because he is a \"leftist source\", as though WP excludes some parts of the political spectrum in its coverage.\nGetting back to Wikipedia policy, I'll recall that our fundamental policy of WP:NPOV says that we \"represent fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all of the significant views\" on a topic. Yes, of course, they have to be \"significant\" views and published in \"reliable sources\", but calling something WP:FRINGE because some editors don't like it or because it is \"leftist\" or because there have been vehement denunciations of it by its political opponents doesn't make it \"fringe\".\nSome form of the Kostopoulos material (maybe not exactly the text that was added) does belong in the article. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5yZ1wePKHbbT3hSUVFHXFxIAU1W", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930511, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3783, "completion_tokens": 43, "total_tokens": 3826}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | GGT | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | Macrakis | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

For example, this  is clearly bunk. The mainstream view is that a) what happened to the Greeks of Pontus was genocide, and b) the casualties were of the order of 350,000-360,000.  This is backed by sources such as Adam Jones, Rudolf Rummel, Merrill Peterson, the IAGS, and others.  Are we to believe that all these sources made the same mistake as Valavanis?  Kostopoulos is a far-left Greek academic with a minimal publication record  (I only see 5 publications, each cited only a handful of times). As far as I can tell, the only \"praise\" for Kostopoulos comes from -surprise- fellow far-left Greek academics.  I have yet to see actual evidence of \"praise\" from the more prominent names mentioned here.  His book is not peer-reviewed but published by \u0392\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1, a Marxist Greek publisher .  Some have said that his political affiliation is irrelevant.  I beg to differ, it is ''very'' relevant.  The Greek far-left has something of an obsession with the events of 1914-1922, most notoriously exemplified by the much-ridiculed \"\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\" quip by Maria Repousi and the latest outburst that \"it was ethnic cleansing but not genocide\" by Nikos Filis (neither of them historians, but didn't stop them from dabbling to inflame this highly charged issue).  The fact that Kostopoulos a) contradicts mainstream scholarship and b) has clear ideological baggage places him in WP:FRINGE territory indeed.  Macrakis is right in one thing:  This is a highly charged and political topic.  Which is all the more reason to avoid highly partisan sources with a clear political agenda, and stick to reliable and non-partisan sources. |\n| 7 | Dr.K. | I agree. I add that there is an element of ideological motivation/bias in Kostopoulos's writings which should be further evaluated and analysed, with the help of other reliable sources, before any of it goes into the article. In any case, I will be brief by necessity, as I will be on the road for some time, with sporadic Internet access. I may come back to this discussion as wifi access/time allows.

This is from what I could find on one \"Stephen A. Coston Sr\" via a quick google: he appears to be a self-published religious fundamentalist who has never been published in any peer-reviewed academic journal. I would therefore guess he isn't considered a reputable historian by any recognised experts of the field. Certainly, the Coston page linked to is an appalling piece of POV nonsense. The statement: \"Also in the strictist terms the King was married for 20 years and had nine children to the same woman, therefore he could not have been a homosexual, but was instead a faithful husband.\" is laughable idiocy.  (Oscar Wilde had two children. Andre Gide married but eloped with the son of his best man. He later conceived a child with another woman. And so on.) But all this is beside the point. The article is meant to be factual, not speculative, hence Coston doesn't belong here. However you may wish to create a special page for him to outline all his deeply fascinating theories for the dumb multitudes - including why James, Carr and Buckingham were just bestest pals.\nEngleham |\n| 2 | Potters house | Thanks for talking, There are problems with the revert as I did also remove a link that was in an inappropriate place and placed it (or rather left the one) in the Refs.

Nick. |\n| 3 | Engleham | \"If you understand that the King was a protestant King who made many Catholic enemies, you can understand why many Catholic sites proclaim that James was gay.\" The belief by most recognised scholars that James was primarily homosexual isn't based on Catholic slurs, contemporary or otherwise. It's based on primary evidence. Even if you dismiss eyewitness accounts of his behavior as \"biased\", his own love letters and the fact that he showered honours and fortune on handsome young men for no reason would be enough to seal the case beyond reasonable doubt. However, given homophobia, and the fact that he's seen an a Protestant and Christian icon, this is all subject to *unreasonable* doubt and spurious claims. Any Wikipedia entry for such a figures immediately becomes a battle ground between Protestants, Catholics, English, Scots, right-wing Christians, gays, etc, etc. The best option in such circumstances is for the article to stick to simple facts, and not tediously cater for the various speculations, often bizarre, of the various camps. So, with regard to James's relationships with young men, it's preferable the article simply state what occurred, and leave it at that. Which is what it was doing before your additions. I won't even bother to read your links because I've read the primary sources, not twisted accounts by wingnuts, and I suggest you do the same. I'm again deleting your additions for the reasons given above, and because Coston is not a recognised scholar, and the article includes no other speculations by any other scholars, so your addition makes the article wildly unbalanced. The pre-existing neutral sentence: \"The question of James' sexuality was a point of controversy during his lifetime and has remained so.\" succinctly sums up the issue for an article that is already very long. As previously, I suggest you create a Coston page.\nEngleham |\n| 4 | Potters house | It seems that you are content on having a biased article. Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral i.e. having both or all sides of the story so that the informed reader can make up their own minds as to further study or investigation of claims. Whether James was Gay or not, it is not the issue, the issue is having a non biased article. At present the article basically says \"James was Gay\" but there are many who contest that view. This is a fact and must be mentioned because it provides the reader with the whole picture, not one sided bias. If, for example the article stated that James was not gay, and you came along and said that he is gay, although I might not like it, I would be forced to let you add that to the article because there is indeed many vocal people who claim this. For this reason I am reverting the article. If this cannot be reasoned perhaps we can mediate.

For example, this  is clearly bunk. The mainstream view is that a) what happened to the Greeks of Pontus was genocide, and b) the casualties were of the order of 350,000-360,000.  This is backed by sources such as Adam Jones, Rudolf Rummel, Merrill Peterson, the IAGS, and others.  Are we to believe that all these sources made the same mistake as Valavanis?  Kostopoulos is a far-left Greek academic with a minimal publication record  (I only see 5 publications, each cited only a handful of times). As far as I can tell, the only \"praise\" for Kostopoulos comes from -surprise- fellow far-left Greek academics.  I have yet to see actual evidence of \"praise\" from the more prominent names mentioned here.  His book is not peer-reviewed but published by \u0392\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1, a Marxist Greek publisher .  Some have said that his political affiliation is irrelevant.  I beg to differ, it is ''very'' relevant.  The Greek far-left has something of an obsession with the events of 1914-1922, most notoriously exemplified by the much-ridiculed \"\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\" quip by Maria Repousi and the latest outburst that \"it was ethnic cleansing but not genocide\" by Nikos Filis (neither of them historians, but didn't stop them from dabbling to inflame this highly charged issue).  The fact that Kostopoulos a) contradicts mainstream scholarship and b) has clear ideological baggage places him in WP:FRINGE territory indeed.  Macrakis is right in one thing:  This is a highly charged and political topic.  Which is all the more reason to avoid highly partisan sources with a clear political agenda, and stick to reliable and non-partisan sources. |\n| 7 | Dr.K. | I agree. I add that there is an element of ideological motivation/bias in Kostopoulos's writings which should be further evaluated and analysed, with the help of other reliable sources, before any of it goes into the article. In any case, I will be brief by necessity, as I will be on the road for some time, with sporadic Internet access. I may come back to this discussion as wifi access/time allows. Thank you all. |\n| 8 | Ashmedai 119 | My response is rather long, and I hope you will bear with me. I first respond regarding the disagreement regarding the number of 350,000 casualties in the Pontus region: Athenean only contributes his/her profession of disbelief that a number of reliable sources could possibly make the same error in reproducing Valavanis's number to justify the removal of Kostopoulos's and Voutira's point on the discrepancy of the number with population statistics. However, a WP editor's disbelief in the veracity of a point made in a RS is of no significance in determining whether this point should be included in an article and should not be a matter of concern in this discussion. I point, however, that this situation that troubles Athenean is easily explained by the reliance of scholars and lobbyists for the \"genocide\" POV who are not themselves engaged in historical research on Fotiadis's work, which has been the work of reference for the matter in these circles. As Kostopoulos notes, Valavanis's numbers are uncritically reproduced in Fotiadis's work. As even Speros Vryonis (who shares Fotiadis's point of view on the suitability of using the term \"genocide\" for the persecution of Ottoman Greeks) admits, Fotiadis has a cavalier attitude with the numbers he cites, remarking that in Fotiadis's work \"it is not always clear whether the total numbers refer to conscriptions in Pontus or to more general figures of Greeks conspricted everywhere.\" (\"Greek Labor Battalions in Asia Minor,\" in Richard Hovannisian (ed.), ''The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies'', (Transaction Publishers, 2007), p. 287). One might not accept this as a valid exaplanation of why Valavanis's numbers are being reproduced, one might even discard Vryonis's criticism of Fotiadis, or doubt that Kostopoulos's book and Voutira's peer-reviewed article are correct in their criticism of Valavanis's confused calculations, but this is no reason to exclude one side of this scholarly discussion from being presented in the article.\nI now come to the matter of the alleged political character of Kostopoulos's scholarship and, then, to its position in relation to the \"mainstream\" of historical scholarship. There is a grain of truth (actually, two grains) in what Athenean writes. First, Kostopoulos's political views -to the extent that I can judge from his public appearances and talks- seem to be firmly on the left and sympathetic to Marxism. Second, the persecution of Ottoman Greeks is an issue of Greek history that has become highly politicised in Greek politics and more broadly in Greek society, especially after the issuance of two Parliament decreees in 1994 and 1998 recognizing two genocides and the 2014 enactment of a law forbidding the \"intentional ... approval, debasemnt or malevolent denial\" (Law 4285/2014, article 2) of Parliament-recognized genocides.\nBut, merely for a scholar to have an express political position does not mean that his scholarly work is determined by it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral i.e. having both or all sides of the story so that the informed reader can make up their own minds as to further study or investigation of claims. Whether James was Gay or not, it is not the issue, the issue is having a non biased article. At present the article basically says \"James was Gay\" but there are many who contest that view. This is a fact and must be mentioned because it provides the reader with the whole picture, not one sided bias. If, for example the article stated that James was not gay, and you came along and said that he is gay, although I might not like it, I would be forced to let you add that to the article because there is indeed many vocal people who claim this. For this reason I am reverting the article. If this cannot be reasoned perhaps we can mediate. Also when you finish a post please put 4 ~'s, that will put your name and time you posted, thanks. |\n| 5 | Engleham | \"At present the article basically says \"James was Gay\"\"\nIt doesn't say that at all. In covering his life it necessarily details the fact that he fell in love with a succession of young men. Whether the relationships were platonic or sexual is left up to reader to decide. The article simply presents the facts.\n\"but there are many who contest that view. This is a fact and must be mentioned\"\nAnd the article does. With this eloquent sentence which sums three centuries of bitching:\n\"The question of James' sexuality was a point of controversy during his lifetime and has remained so.\"\nI didn't write that sentence, but it reads very plain and balanced to me.\nBut I don't think you're being honest. You want Coston in. Forget it. You may as well reference David Irving. If I don't delete him, others eventually will. So if you don't lose the battle today, you will tomorrow. On high profile Wiki articles like this, the record shows that flake references don't survive. That said, I don't believe this article will ever amount to much because there's too many conflicting interests resulting in endless edit wars. e.g the current utterly misleading minor reference to Esme Stuart indicates some previous shitfight. I'm not about to waste my time fixing it.\nI do scratch my head though as to why fundamentalist Christians have, in the last few years, suddenly decided to make James some kind of holy icon, and its so desperately important to them that be a certified heterosexual, merely because of his association with the King James Version. It's as tenuous and stupid as suddenly deciding to canonise Elizabeth II because, say, a bridge had been commissioned in her name. |\n| 6 | Potters house | It seems that you are not willing to discuss this so I will invite a mediator in to try and sort this out. In regards to your personal attacks on fundamentalist Christians who \"try\" to make James some kind of holy icon, it would do you well to read the above links that I posted (which you refused to read), as this is neither a novel thing or unfactual. The argument is not that you think he is gay and I think he is not, the argument is that there are facts on both sides that need to be known. To say that the statement \"The question of James' sexuality was a point of controversy during his lifetime and has remained so\" is enough information on the issue is inaccurate and misleading.\nAlso to say that sourcing Coston is like quoting David Irving, and also the Personal attacks on my capability to source information is uncalled for. I have provided many other links but you simply refused to look. You are demonstrating a personal bias which is not helping the issue which seems to have been a problem before http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Engleham |\n| 7 | Engleham | I think I've been more than generous in the time I've wasted humouring you. Which really, is all one can do. As you obviously find homosexuality so horrible that you need to distort historical truth, may I suggest you go and rewrite, say, most of the Renaissance artist entries?

Elevated to the earldom of Lennox (the existing holder of the title, Robert Stewart, bishop of Caithness, having yielded to royal pressure to resign it) in 1580 and then raised to a dukedom in 1581, Lennox was loathed as a pro-French Catholic who enjoyed all too much of the king's favour.''\n''Much has been made of James as the lonely teenager desperate for affection, and no doubt this played a part. But what we are seeing here is the start of a pattern which was repeated in the case of James's other three great favourites: George Gordon, earl of Huntly; and, in England, Robert Carr, earl of Somerset, and George Villiers, duke of Buckingham. James had asserted his kingship, not his loneliness; his authority, not his dependence. Lennox, like his successors, appeared on the scene and demonstrated his usefulness, in this case in the factional struggles surrounding the king, notably in his part in Morton's final downfall.''\nRe: later favorites, court culture, question of James's sexuality in general:\n''It is in this scrambling, hothouse environment that the notorious royal favourites must be set. Sir Walter Scott introduced the note of immorality; and some modern scholars\u2014notably literary critics\u2014still find the question of James's homosexuality a source of great fascination. There is almost the danger of forgetting that, '''even if homosexual activity as opposed to homoerotic feeling is ascribed to the king,''' at the very least, James was bisexual, and succeeded, where his three predecessors had failed, in providing |\n| 2 | Potters house | It is a silly argument. The \"major minority\" says that James is a homosexual. Most people would just go \"ok\" and go back to their lives. Coston wrote a book refuting this \"major minority.\" If I said that Elvis was still alive and got a following and became a \"major minority\" one would naturally conclude that most of the general population would not agree and also would not be vocal about this because it doesn't effect them. When a minority says that King James is a homosexual one would naturally conclude that most of the general population would not agree and also would not be vocal about this because it doesn't effect them. A critic of a minority will usually be a smaller minority, because who is going to bother with such rubbish anyhow. We know Elvis is dead. We know the King of England was married with many children wrote books condemning homosexuality and effeminates, and was hated and slandered by many different groups. Most see these facts and simply conclude that James wasn't gay. Thus my point is that most agree that he was not gay but few vocalize it because it is mostly self explanatory. A homosexual is a person who has relations with men only. The correct terminology is bisexual. The whole logic is silly. Coston may well be the voice of the silent majority. Also scandal sells, so to say that well thought out material like Coston\u2019s is unimportant is wrong. The sensationalized press and books authors and sellers love this type of hype. Coston's link is a seeming minority who supports the views of the majority.\nI suppose Steve Erwin had sex with animals because he \"loved\" animals? Same logic used here. But who would believe a silly argument like that? And if an ungrounded argument like that had a serious rebuttal - it should be considered. Even if it was just a link. |\n| 3 | John K | What \"majority\" rejects the idea that James was homosexual?  How can you possibly substantiate that?  The vast \"majority\" has no idea.  Of those who have looked at the subject, a clear majority have suggested that, at the least, James had a homoerotic attachment to some of his favorites (particularly Buckingham).  Whether or not there were actually physical sexual relationships is unclear.  The fact that James was married and had children is entirely irrelevant.  So did Oscar Wilde.  Most of the supposed arguments against James's homosexuality currently in the article are nonsense.  On the other hand, I think the case for James's homosexuality is not as strong as other parts of the article would suggest.  Basically, we have fairly limited sources, and, such as they are, they aren't really sufficient to say for sure one way or the other.  James's statements about his favorites seem highly suggestive of homoerotic attraction, but to assert actual homosexual relationships on this basis seems problematic.  That James was homosexual (or, rather, that he was sexually attracted to other men, or, more strongly, was involved in sexual relationships with other men) seems a reasonable inference, but there isn't anything more than circumstantial evidence (if that) to back it up.  The problem comes in when people view this question not as a simple question of facts and evidence, but as part of an ideological tug of war, where the evidence that James ''was'' homosexual is ''a priori'' found to be false because it conflicts with people's religious views with respect to the version of the Bible that James authorized (for some reason or other - I'm not sure why James can't have both commissioned a good version of the Bible ''and'' have engaged in homosexual acts - David is the ideal Biblical king, but his behavior with respect to Bathsheba and Uriah was highly dishonorable to a much greater extent than any indiscretions one |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5zBEHhQPb3KGWiCW1KcUkEh1UWN", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930549, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3810, "completion_tokens": 58, "total_tokens": 3868}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | John K | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 2 | Potters house | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 3 | John K | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

I would say that the majority position on James's sexuality is something along the lines of \"The evidence is ambiguous at best, but there is considerable evidence that James, at least, had homoerotic attractions to certain of his male favorites, particularly Buckingham.\"  This is the viewpoint taken for granted, I think, by the ODNB extracts I quoted above.  Note Wormald's comment that I bolded, in particular, which puts the debate as between those who attribute active homosexual activities to James and those who contend that his attractions for his favorites were homoerotic without being sexual.  If somebody had access to some good recent biographies of James (or Buckingham, or Somerset, or Lennox), that would go a long way towards substantiating this. |\n| 6 | PhilKnight | Ok, if anything, the mainstream sources are slightly less decisive than your summary, so I would change \"at least\" to \"almost certainly\".

I saw a Bigfoot back in June of 1991 and that kind of opened the door to me to the whole Bigfoot phenomena.  When I was a small child I saw the film and was scared of it.  After my sighting I watched the Patterson-Gimlin film several dozen times and I concluded Bigfoot I saw that day in 1991 looked VERY CLOSE to the creature in the Patterson-Gimlin film.  The creature in the film was just under 7' and was a female due to the fact that it had breasts.  The one I saw was about 8' and a male I believe.  In the last few years the film has undergone digital analysis and examination and those that did the analysis COULD NOT determine that the film was faked.  Bigfoot researcher John Green back in 1967 shortly after the film was made went back to the site and filmed a stand-in model-Jim McClarin- walking the same path that the creature took as a reference to determine the height and weight of the creature in the film.  The two films were superimposed to show the difference between the two.  McClarin stood 6'.5\".  The creature in the film was taller and much more bulkier.  The arms on the creature are longer than a normal man's arms.  I recently viewed the film digitally enhanced at a meeting of the International Bigfoot Society.  I could see the muscles moving underneath the hair of the creature.  The creature walks with an unusual bent-knee gait that is almost impossible to imitate.  The late Dr. Grover Krantz tried once to imitate it but was unsuccessful.  Several anatomists have recently discovered some sort of injury on the creature's knee as it flexes its knee when it's walking.  I can see no seams on the creature that would indicate a costume.  Apes have a natural hair seam running down the length of their spines.  As to the feet in the film- the area that the creature walked in the film was on sand and very soft soil which stuck to the creature's feet, as it would to any animal or human for that matter that would be walking in soil like that with bare feet.  When the creature turns to look at the camera, it just doesn't move its head- it moves its entire upper torso in the direction of the cameraman- just as an ape would do.  The creature turned to look at the camera because Bob Gimlin had crossed the creek and trained his rifle on it after Patterson told him to cover him in case the creature was agressive.  That's why the creature turned to look at the camera.  If this creature was a man in a costume, why would he risk his life with Gimlin having a loaded rifle aimed at him?  That doesn't make sense.  Patterson ran out of film because the rest of the film in his camera had been used filming scenery for a documentary he wanted to do.  Before he could change the film in his rented camera the creature had disappeared into the woods.  Patterson and Gimlin did trail it but couldn't go any further because the creature's trail went into the mountains and they couldn't follow with their horses and they weren't logistically equipped to go up the mountain after the creature.  The film is shaky because Patterson was running after the creature while he was filming it and finally stabilized himself on a tree stump.  Patterson did not know anything about cameras or film speeds.  I have personally met Bob Gimlin and heard what he had to say about what Patterson filmed that day.  He sticks to his story that what he saw that day was a flesh and blood creature and not some guy in a fur suit.  Gimlin never made any money whatsoever on the film.  I am not trying to say that what everyone else believes is wrong; I'm just saying what I know about the film and I believe it to be authentic.  This was suppossed to have been faked by an ex-rodeo cowboy?  Hardly.\nDarin (UTC |\n| 2 | DRR75 | I can tell you all about my sighting, but I thought this discussion group was only for the Patterson film.

The bigfoot in the film is a hoax, deal with it. |\n| 7 | 71.50.10.144 | No, the film is NOT a hoax.  That is a genuine creature in that film.  I have met and talked with Bob Gimlin.

I could say that I have met Doc Shiels, and he said that his pictures of the Loch Ness Monster are true.  He sticks to his story that what he saw that day was a flesh and blood lake creature.  Have YOU ever met Doc Shiels?  I have been involved in the Loch Ness Monster phenomenon for 16 years.  I believe I know what I'm talking about.  SEE HOW STUPID THAT SOUNDS???   Bob Gimlim has been making $$$ off this video, just because you met him has nothing to do with the validity of the film. Bob has said many things over the years, including that he admitted that he could have been fooled, too.  He also won't deny Bob Heironimus's confession of being the guy in the suit. Not consistent, now is he? The bigfoot in the film is fake, get over it.  By the way, I have met Bob Heironimus and he maintains that he wore the suit.  Have YOU met Bob Heironimus.  I have been debunking bigfoot claims for over 20 years.  I believe I know what I'm talking about.

Ask yourself whether the source is reliable; whether the material is being presented as true; and whether, even if true, it is relevant to a disinterested article about the subject. Be wary of relying on sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. Also beware of circular reporting, in which material in a Wikipedia article gets picked up by a source, which is later cited in the Wikipedia article to support the original edit.\nBy every standard of Wikipedia, a paper with a reputation and amount of peer awards (47 Pulitzer Prizes) is the absolute gold standard for WP:RS in reporting (obviously there are things outside of Journalism, like peer reviews)\nThis isn't gossip.

Both Kushner and Trump Jr. wanted to be more transparent and honest, but Donald Trump ordered a deceptive version. That's described below as a possible coverup:\n Trump dictated son\u2019s misleading statement on meeting with Russian lawyer\n \"The extent of the president\u2019s personal intervention in his son\u2019s response, the details of which have not previously been reported, adds to a series of actions that Trump has taken that some advisers fear could place him and some members of his inner circle in legal jeopardy.\n \"As special counsel Robert S. Mueller III looks into potential obstruction of justice as part of his broader investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, these advisers worry that the president\u2019s direct involvement leaves him needlessly vulnerable to allegations of a coverup.\"\n \"...\u201cNow someone can claim he\u2019s the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn\u2019t want you to say the whole truth.\u201d\"\n \"...Trump, they say, is increasingly acting as his own lawyer, strategist and publicist, often disregarding the recommendations of the professionals he has hired.\n \u201cHe refuses to sit still,\u201d the presidential adviser said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s in any legal jeopardy, so he really views this as a political problem he is going to solve by himself.\u201d\n \"...Because Trump believes he is innocent, some advisers explained, he therefore does not think he is at any legal risk for a coverup. In his mind, they said, there is nothing to conceal.\" |\n| 2 | DarthBotto | I'm unsure if we should refer to it as a \"cover-up\", as it may not have been of unscrupulous intent, but it is imperative that we include Trump's directive in addressing this matter. \u00a0\u2022 |\n| 3 | DarthBotto | While we're at it, Trump's lawyer has released a statement, denying his client's involvement. \u00a0\u2022 |\n| 4 | Casprings | There are some important facts in that story.

When you read the article, you can see how weak it is - big let down with nothing to back it up.

What about pictures of Quilombos? Pictures of streets of favelas? Oh, right, they show a third-world country and therefore foreign people will not visit Brazil, and moreover, the people who would be related to these pictures are less Brazilian than those german ladies\u00bf\nReading this article, one may also think, judging by posh office buildings shown, that Brazil is like Dubai. No contrast is being shown, right in the article of a country with perhaps the most serious social inequalty issues in the world.\nThe emphasis on the pictures of beaches also endorses the jargon of Brazil being a land solely of \"Playas belas\". Not that they are unnecessary - Brazil has plenty of playas belas - but we should add pictures of universities, Embraer workshops, Alcantara Space Launcher, or anything that could depict how advanced is Brazilian technology instead of filling it up with tropical scenarios.\nReality '''is''' harsh, you cannot deny it pretending that here it's all about parties, Olodum and beaches. '''People may think that I am making a fuss about nothing, but the pictures are what draw most of any user's atention while visiting an article - many reading only the sections with the most interesting illustrations.'''\nBut there is no need for worries. I shall not be replacing the current photos again. I also send my congratulations to user Jo\u00e3o Felipe C.S, for showing the world the real Brazil that I was unaware of. He is so right, that he added all these pictures without any discussion here first, and I guess that plenty of Brazilians agree with him having not protested at all. I give up then, but I am very happy though, because my country is so rich and I did not even know it!\nBest regards,\nFrom a Brazilian who seems to know pretty much nothing about his own country. |\n| 2 | Ezadarque | Dont give up. It seems to me that not everyone thinks those pictures should be there, I know I do not. This article will give the first impression of Brazil to thousands of people, we should really try to make it the most accurate possible. Let's try not to stereotype the population: I think the three pictures, the olodum players, the southern girls, and the indians give an idea of distinct ethnicities that is opposite to the reality of Brazil. Brazil is probably the country with more racial mixture, that is what should be pictured.\nAs Brazilian culture is concerned, I don't think that we should picture any museums. Brazilian culture is not famous for its museums, but for its music. I put a picture of a Carnival parade, which, in my opinion, would be the most representative, but I think that a capoeira picture is also pretty good. Ipiranga and MAC, however, are not well-known even within Brazil.\nFurthermore, I don't think that Blumenau or Curitiba should be pictured. I really don't see the informational value for a foreigner that wants to know about Brazil.\nLet's not forget that this article (as almost every article in wikipedia) is probably the most influential piece of information on the country. We should put regional vanities and nationalism aside and try to make a good text. |\n| 3 | 201.21.200.15 | Tosh. This is the problem with Brazilians. Anything from the North and the Northeast is proudly exhibited as an icon of Brazil, no matter how non-representative, whereas people from Southern Brazil are never considered \"Brazilian\" enough. If THAT isn't racism, I don't know what is. What is the problem of including a few pictures from typical places in Southern Brazil? There's Olodum already (quite \"African\", uh?) and Indians. Now Blumenau is too much \"European\" for your taste? Well, I'm sorry, but it's in Brazil too. And many places in that forgotten corner of Southern Brazil are just like that, like it or not. Don't try to erase history and simply ignore the importance of Southern Brazil. |\n| 4 | Ezadarque | I think you misunderstand my point. I am alson in favor of removing the olodum players, and the indians. That's not how most of our population looks like. I repeat, we are probably the most mixed people in the world, and an article should show what is particular of a country, not what is equal. There would be no point in showing that in Brazil the red light means \"stop\" in traffic, because that's the same all over the world. Similarly, even though those girls and the Blumenau house are in Brazil, they don't picture anything particularly Brazilian. Capoeira does. Carnival does. The contemporary art museum in Niter\u00f3i does not. This article is not to show everything that is in Brazil, only the most remarkable about it.\nIf instead of the girls, a gaucho was pictured, it would be a lot more representative. So the problem is not that those pictures are from the south, only that they add a lot less to the understanding of Brazil than other pictures could. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5zj6uQ6xoFZTEsiby127qetPTtr", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930583, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3722, "completion_tokens": 79, "total_tokens": 3801}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 201.58.220.155 | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 2 | Ezadarque | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | 201.21.200.15 | Cold |\n| 4 | Ezadarque | Warm-Agreeable |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}

If Jack123... has a reliable source that says that the alt-right is not opposed to mutliculturalism. he should provide it. |\n| 5 | Jack1234567891011121314151617 | @Beyond My Ken Don't you think that the alt right advocating for an ethno state is evidence enough? |\n| 6 | Beyond My Ken | Nope, nowhere near enough. In fact, your stretching of their position strains credulity, since it's completely bullshit. |\n\n| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Jack1234567891011121314151617 | Gregarious-Extraverted |\n| 2 | Lukacris | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 3 | Jack1234567891011121314151617 | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 4 | Beyond My Ken | Unassuming-Ingenuous |\n| 5 | Jack1234567891011121314151617 | Unassured-Submissive |\n| 6 | Beyond My Ken | Cold |\n---\n| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Ezadarque | I think you misunderstand my point. I am alson in favor of removing the olodum players, and the indians. That's not how most of our population looks like. I repeat, we are probably the most mixed people in the world, and an article should show what is particular of a country, not what is equal. There would be no point in showing that in Brazil the red light means \"stop\" in traffic, because that's the same all over the world. Similarly, even though those girls and the Blumenau house are in Brazil, they don't picture anything particularly Brazilian. Capoeira does. Carnival does. The contemporary art museum in Niter\u00f3i does not. This article is not to show everything that is in Brazil, only the most remarkable about it.\nIf instead of the girls, a gaucho was pictured, it would be a lot more representative. So the problem is not that those pictures are from the south, only that they add a lot less to the understanding of Brazil than other pictures could. |\n| 5 | 201.58.197.20 | I am not complaining about the German related pictures, and I do not think that they should be removed. I am against the prestige that they have in this article. There is more German culture depicted than African, and that is really unfair since there is more people and things related to Africa than to Germany in Brazil. Moreover, '''this article is not accurate as it does not show the poverty that exists in this country, which cannot be denied. Anyone who checks our country's streets with his own eyes will see how false is the idea of Brazil that this article conveys'''. |\n| 6 | Carlosguitar | It seems that everyone agree with the prestige that the German influence related pictures have in this article, so I think that we should also change the official language to German as well, as it looks as if we were colonized by Germans. What about pictures of Quilombos? Pictures of streets of favelas? Oh, right, they show a third-world country and therefore foreign people will not visit Brazil, and moreover, the people who would be related to these pictures are less Brazilian than those german ladies\u00bf\nReading this article, one may also think, judging by posh office buildings shown, that Brazil is like Dubai. No contrast is being shown, right in the article of a country with perhaps the most serious social inequalty issues in the world.\nThe emphasis on the pictures of beaches also endorses the jargon of Brazil being a land solely of \"Playas belas\". Not that they are unnecessary - Brazil has plenty of playas belas - but we should add pictures of universities, Embraer workshops, Alcantara Space Launcher, or anything that could depict how advanced is Brazilian technology instead of filling it up with tropical scenarios.\nReality '''is''' harsh, you cannot deny it pretending that here it's all about parties, Olodum and beaches. '''People may think that I am making a fuss about nothing, but the pictures are what draw most of any user's atention while visiting an article - many reading only the sections with the most interesting illustrations.'''\nBut there is no need for worries. I shall not be replacing the current photos again. I also send my congratulations to user Jo\u00e3o Felipe C.S, for showing the world the real Brazil that I was unaware of. He is so right, that he added all these pictures without any discussion here first, and I guess that plenty of Brazilians agree with him having not protested at all. I give up then, but I am very happy though, because my country is so rich and I did not even know it!\nBest regards,\nFrom a Brazilian who seems to know pretty much nothing about his own country. \n Dont give up. It seems to me that not everyone thinks those pictures should be there, I know I do not. This article will give the first impression of Brazil to thousands of people, we should really try to make it the most accurate possible. Let's try not to stereotype the population: I think the three pictures, the olodum players, the southern girls, and the indians give an idea of distinct ethnicities that is opposite to the reality of Brazil. Brazil is probably the country with more racial mixture, that is what should be pictured.\nAs Brazilian culture is concerned, I don't think that we should picture any museums. Brazilian culture is not famous for its museums, but for its music. I put a picture of a Carnival parade, which, in my opinion, would be the most representative, but I think that a capoeira picture is also pretty good. Ipiranga and MAC, however, are not well-known even within Brazil.\nFurthermore, I don't think that Blumenau or Curitiba should be pictured. I really don't see the informational value for a foreigner that wants to know about Brazil.\nLet's not forget that this article (as almost every article in wikipedia) is probably the most influential piece of information on the country. We should put regional vanities and nationalism aside and try to make a good text. |"}], "temperature": 0.4, "top_p": 1.0}, "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7S5zqMJ8OJbsnD0PYQPKVzpRxj6fP", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1686930590, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3668, "completion_tokens": 66, "total_tokens": 3734}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Utterance ID | Speaker ID | Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Ezadarque | Warm-Agreeable |\n| 5 | 201.58.197.20 | Arrogant-Calculating |\n| 6 | Carlosguitar | Arrogant-Calculating |"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}}
